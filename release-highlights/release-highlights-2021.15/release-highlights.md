## Release 2021.15
----------------------------------------------------------
## New features and enhancements

### [Attribute-value filtering](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/text-input-group/react-demos#attribute-value-filtering)

This demo shows how to use the new Text input group component to create a type-ahead filter for filtering a large data set using multiple key-value tags.

### [Horizontal table scrolling with sticky columns](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/table#composable-sticky-column)

![table with horizontal scrolling and sticky columns](./img/table-sticky-columns.png)

 Allow a table to scroll horizontally while keeping some number of columns always visible from the left edge. This is currently implemented for the composable table, only. We will follow up with support for the legacy React table in a future release.

 ### [Nested table headings](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/table#composable-nested-column-headers-and-expandable-rows)

![table with nested column headers](./img/table-nested-columns.png)

 You can now optionally nest multiple columns under one heading (composable table, only).

### [Default table sort direction](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/table#isortby)

Added a new prop to allow the consumer to select whether the default sort should be ascending or descending when initially clicking on a column header.

### [Pagination with indeterminate count](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/pagination#indeterminate)

![pagination with indeterminate count](./img/indeterminate-pagination.png)

This update allows for substituting the word "many" for the item count when the total count of items cannot be retrieved.

### [Dashboard design guidelines](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/guidelines/dashboards)

New documentation introduced to guide designers in best practices for designing dashboards using PatternFly.

See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.
