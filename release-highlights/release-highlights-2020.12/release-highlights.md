# PatternFly Release Highlights
## Release 2020.12
### New features and enhancements
#### Introduce support for favorites into the [Select component](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/select#favorites)

This feature allows for marking items as favorites to pin them to the top of the menu. This is especially useful when you have a long list of potential options but a smaller number that will be used frequently. **Note:** inclusion of dividers in the Select menu (as shown above) is still not implemented in this release. This feature will be added in a follow-up PR during our next release milestone.

#### [Table header fix](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/4778)
Fixed a bug that prevented  interactive elements from being added to sortable table headers. This will allow infotip popovers to be triggered from column headers.

#### Introduced the [Skeleton component](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/skeleton)
The new Skeleton component is an animated placeholder that can be used to implement skeleton loading on a page. We offer a variety of sizes and shapes to take the place of text strings or graphical elements like charts.

#### Added a [bottom panel drawer](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/drawer#panel-on-bottom) variation

This adds a horizontal drawer that can be attached to the bottom of a page. This is most useful when you want to insert a terminal window or something similar that will slide up from the bottom the viewport.

#### Introduced a [Label group](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/label-group) component
Label groups have similar properties to Chip groups. They can include an optional  category label and can manage overflow conditions if there are many labels in the group.

See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.

### Web site changes
Also with this release we are introducing a new website experience at [www.patternfly.org](http://www.patternfly.org). This update will make it easier to find content and browse examples.

**Highlights include:**

1. Everything consolidated into a single collapsible menu. Based on user research studies conducted earlier this year, we have simplified our site navigation by placing all pages into a single vertical menu.

2. React and HTML examples as well as design guidelines are now consolidated on a common component page. This will ensure that all of the information about a component can be found in one place without the need to switch around between sections of the site.

3. A Table of Contents sidebar was introduced to make it easier to directly navigate to the examples or documentation you are looking for when on any component page.

These improvements should make the PatternFly website much easier to use. We welcome any questions or feedback that you have as you familiarize yourself with the new site.
