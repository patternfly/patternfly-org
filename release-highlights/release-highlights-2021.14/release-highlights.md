![plain menu](./img/plain-menu.png)

Adds a "plain" variant of the Menu component that does not have borders for use inline within a page.

### [Add placeholder text to Select](https://staging.patternfly.org/v4/components/select#with-a-style-applied-to-the-placeholder-text)

![select with placeholder text](./img/select-with-placeholder.png)

Allows placeholder text styling to be applied to a Select component to differentiate a null selection from other options.

### [Text input group](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/text-input-group)

![text input group](./img/text-input-group.png)

The text input group is a new component that adds custom features to a standard text input, including the ability to embed a chip group and a clear button. We expect this new component to be useful in constructing composable solutions to common filter and search problems.

See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.
