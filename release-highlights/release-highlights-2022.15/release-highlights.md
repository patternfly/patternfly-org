For multiple file uploads, this gives consumers the ability to customize the progress message that displays to provide better error feedback. This is accomplished by adding the capability to add custom helper text below the progress component.

## What weâ€™re working on...

### 2022.16 (December 9)

* [Menu - add ability to filter items in a drilldown menu](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6965) - will allow for the insertion of a filter within a drilldown menu to narrow the scope of choices when there are potentially many items to choose from.

### 2023.01 (January 27)

* [Bulk selection - display loading state](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4926) - add an inline spinner to the split button used for bulk selection to provide better feedback when bulk select actions will take time to complete.

* [Add Processor icon](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/issues/1210) - Add a new icon to represent a processor object.
