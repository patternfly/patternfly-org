## New features and enhancements

### [Secondary-styled split button](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/dropdown#split-button-secondary-action)

![split button with secondary styling](./img/secondary-split-button.png)

 We've added a split button variant that has secondary button styling for use in situations where you want a split button with button styling for more consistency with other actions on a page.

### [Description list card variant](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/description-list#card-variants)

![description list card variant](./img/description-list-card.png)

Introduces a new variant of the description list that makes items look like a dashboard card but retain description list semantics.

### [Tree view with selectable parent nodes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/tree-view#with-separate-selection-and-expansion)

![tree with selectable parent node](./img/tree-selectable-parents.png)

Parent nodes in a tree view can now have select actions (e.g. for navigation) associated with them as well as being used to expand or collapse the node.

### [Tabs with overflow](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/tabs#horizontal-overflow)

![horizontal tabs with overflow](./img/tabs-with-overflow.png)

If there are too many horizontal tabs to fit within the width of a container, we now support the ability to hide overflowing tabs in a dropdown menu that is opened from the last tab.

### [Responsive progress stepper](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/progress-stepper)

Our progress stepper can now change from a horizontal to vertical orientation as the width of the viewport is reduced.

### [Height breakpoint support for sticky sections](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/page/react-demos#sticky-section-breadcrumb-with-breakpoints)

We now support breakpoints based on the viewport height as well as width. This will allow sticky page section behavior to be modified when the viewport is shrunk below a certain height, allowing sticky page sections to scroll.

See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.
