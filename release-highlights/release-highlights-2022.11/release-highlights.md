## What weâ€™re working on...

### 2022.12 (September 16)

* [Search input - expandable masthead variant](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7380) - adding a variant of the search input that can be used in the masthead and expanded or collapsed inline with other elements.

* [Checkbox - add ability to indicate they are required](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7830) - want to add the ability to add the required indicator (red asterisk) to a checkbox label. This is useful when the user must acknowledge certain information (e.g. terms and conditions) before proceeding.

* [Overflow menu - set breakpoint relative to container width](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7376) - responsive breakpoints are typically based on viewport width. This enhancement will update the [Overflow menu](https://v4-archive.patternfly.org/v4/components/overflow-menu) component to send overflow elements to the overflow menu when its container is resized.

* [PageSection - add ability to specify HTML elements via props](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7419) - add an additional prop to PageSection that allows users to specify the underlying HTML element used, similar to Card and other components.

### 2022.13 (October 7)

* [Plain read-only form input](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4935) - adds the option to place a read-only input into a form that has styling similar to [description list](https://v4-archive.patternfly.org/v4/components/description-list/) items (no background or borders).
