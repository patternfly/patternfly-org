### [Increased click-target size for table checkboxes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/table#composable-selectable-with-checkbox)
This update makes tables with selectable rows more usable by increasing the click target size around checkboxes used to select the row.

### [Progress button demo](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/button/react-demos)
Demonstrates how to use the [progress variation](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/button#progress) of the button component to reflect in-progress and completion states by substituting a success icon for the spinner when done.
