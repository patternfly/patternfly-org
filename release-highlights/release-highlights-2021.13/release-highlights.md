## What weâ€™re working on...

### 2021.14 (October 29)

* [Compact label](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6404) - adds a compact label variant that takes less vertical space to better fit inline with text in a table cell.

* [Plain menu variant](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6367) - adds a "plain" variant of the Menu component that does not have borders for use inline within a form.


### 2021.15 (November 19)

* [Key-value filtering](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6393) - demonstrate how to create a multi-select, key-value filter using existing components.

* [Update selected state visuals for Cards and Tiles](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4358) - introduce new visuals for selectable cards and tiles that are better differentiated from browser focus states.

* [Non-actionable card](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4359) - introduce special styling for "non-actionable" cards that are included inside a grid of actionable cards (e.g. in a catalog view).

* [Horizontal table scrolling with sticky columns](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6163) - Allow a table to scroll horizontally while keeping some number of columns always visible.

* [Allow control over default table sort direction](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/5329) - will allow the consumer to select whether the default sort should be ascending or descending when initially clicking on a column header.
