## What weâ€™re working on...

This will be the last planned release for PatternFly 4. A major new release  (PatternFly 5) is slated for June 2023. This will include many new features, including:

* An updated CSS variable system to provide official support for dark theme and additional themes moving forward.

* React 18 support.

* Improvements to existing components to make them more flexible and efficient to work with.

* Website improvements to make it easier to find what you are looking for, preview components in light or dark theme, and expose documentation for PatternFly extensions.

Codemods, documentation, and developer support will be available to make it easy to migrate from PatternFly 4.
