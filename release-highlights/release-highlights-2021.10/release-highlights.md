## What we’re working on...

### 2021.11 (August 27)

* [Compact tree-view](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6046) - Add a new variant of the tree view component that is better designed to work with dense content and confined spaces.

* [Enable multi-select rows in a table](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6032) - Add a new demo to show how to implement multi-selection of rows through the keyboard in a composable table.

*  [Tree view: make the toolbar/header more flexible](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/5933) - Make the toolbar/header area flexible to pass in anything you want including a search input, actions, or anything that makes sense.

* [Popover: support diagonal positioning](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6075) - Support diagonal positioning of a popover window.

* [Navigation: new horizontal sub-nav menu](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/6045) - Introduce a new horizontal secondary navigation bar that will replace the legacy tertiary navigation for use when you want to support local navigation within a page. The new navigation bar is better differentiated from horizontal tabs.

* [Back to top component](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4255) - Introduce a new component that floats on top of content for long scrolling pages and navigates the user back to the top of the page in a single click.

* [Plain alert variant](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4220) - Adds a new variant of an inline alert that removes borders and background styling.

* [Expandable inline alert](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4056) - Adds a new alert type with an expandable header that allows body content to be hidden for a more compact appearance.

* [Disabled tabs](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4257) - Add a disabled variant for the tabs component. The user can place a tooltip on a disabled tab as they would for other disabled controls.
