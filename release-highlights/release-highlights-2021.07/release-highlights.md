# PatternFly Release Highlights
## Release 2021.07
----------------------------------------------------------
## New features and enhancements

### [Toggle group re-styling](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/toggle-group)

![restyled toggle group](./img/toggle-group.png)

 We updated the selected color for a set of toggle buttons to use a lighter blue. This better differentiates them from primary buttons when placed in a full page layout.

 * [New List variants](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/5336) - Add new variants of the List component to include horizontal separators, icons and 'pf-m-plain' modifier.

 * [Uncontrolled behavior for tabs](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/4458) - To be more developer friendly, the Tabs component will support uncontrolled behavior such that the developer does not need to control which tab is the active one.

 * [Add help text support to Description list items](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/5482) - Add the ability to open help in a popover by clicking of a field label in a Description list.

 * [Add a "danger" variant for secondary and link buttons](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/5578) - Allows danger (red button) styles for additional button types. Currently supported for primary buttons, only.

 * [Allow wizard sub-steps to be collapsed](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/5580) - Allows wizard sub-steps to be hidden and expanded on-demand to reduce clutter in wizards with many steps.
