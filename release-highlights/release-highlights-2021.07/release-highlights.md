  Allows wizard sub-steps to be hidden and expanded on-demand to reduce clutter in wizards with many steps.

  ### [Filter-tree demo](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/demos/composable-menu#filter-tree-menu)

  ![filter-tree](./img/filter-tree.png)

  Using the composable menu component, we demonstrate how to place a tree-view inside of a dropdown to create a "filter-tree" pattern.

 ### [Uncontrolled behavior for tabs](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/tabs#uncontrolled)
 The Tabs component now supports uncontrolled behavior so that the developer does not need to control which tab is the active one.

 ### [Tooltip: added entry delay](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/tooltip)

 Added a 300ms default entry delay to tooltips to prevent immediate firing when passing the mouse over a page. This value can be changed via a prop.


See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.
