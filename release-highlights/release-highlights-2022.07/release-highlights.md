Previously, the toggle in the expandable section component was constrained to only contain a string. This update allows an icon or any other non-interactive component to be placed in the toggle area.

See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.

## What weâ€™re working on...

### 2022.08 (June 24)

* [Add information panel to a wizard](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7258) - this will add an optional sidebar to the body of a wizard for holding more information about completing that step.

* [Tree view: add option to select parent nodes](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7378) - for some use cases, it makes sense for parent nodes in a tree view to have select actions (e.g. for navigation) as well as being used to expand or collapse the node. This enhancement will introduce a new variant of the [tree view](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/tree-view) to support that behavior.

* [Editable label group](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7351) - introduce the ability for the user to add new labels to a label group.

* [Add gold label](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7449) - will add a new label variant that uses our gold palette.

### 2022.09 (July 15 - No release)
* We will not do a feature release in July. Instead, we will use our 2022.09 milestone as a breakaway sprint to focus on process improvement and team driven initiatives.

### 2022.10 (August 5)

* [Search input - dark variant](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4705) - adding a dark variant of the search input that can be used in the masthead or above the vertical navigation menu.

* [Secondary-styled split button](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4798) - adds a split button variant that has secondary button styling.

* [Description list with dashboard styling](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4699) - will introduce that ability to have alternate styling in a description list that makes it look like a dashboard card but appear semantically as a description list.
