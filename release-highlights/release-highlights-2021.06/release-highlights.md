# PatternFly Release Highlights
## Release 2021.06
----------------------------------------------------------
## New features and enhancements

### [Toggle group re-styling](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/toggle-group)

![restyled toggle group](./img/toggle-group.png)

 We updated the selected color for a set of toggle buttons to use a lighter blue. This better differentiates them from primary buttons when placed in a full page layout.

### [Composable dropdown menus](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/demos/composable-menu)

 Composable menus pair a [Menu toggle](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/menu-toggle) and a [Menu](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/menu) component to create flexible dropdown and select menu configurations. This provides a more modular solution for deploying menus. Existing dropdown and select components are still supported.

### [View more action added to Select](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/select#view-more)

![select with view more](./img/view-more.png)

We've added a view more action to the bottom of a select menu to enable incremental loading of long option lists.

### [Complex actions now supported in a table](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/table#actions-and-first-cell-in-body-rows-as-th)

![table with complex actions](./img/table-with-actions.png)

We now support adding any type of actions to table rows. Formerly, only actions (kabob) menus were supported.

### [Log viewer component (beta)](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/log-viewer)

![log viewer](./img/log-viewer.png)

 Introduces a native log viewer component to display real-time streamed logs or static log data. The toolbar is fully customizable. This is currently work in progress with a number of enhancements and improvements to be introduced over upcoming releases. With that in mind, you are encouraged to use this and provide feedback.

See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.
