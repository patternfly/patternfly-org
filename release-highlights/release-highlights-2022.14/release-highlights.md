Adds optional "danger" menu option styling to use for potentially destructive actions.

### [Banner - support for status icons]()

To make our banners more accessible, we've' built in support for a status icon preceding a text message when color is meant to convey status. This will enable redundant coding for color blind users.

See the [latest release notes](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/developer-resources/release-notes) for a more detailed list of changes.
