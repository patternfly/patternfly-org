# PatternFly Release Highlights
## Release 2022.12
----------------------------------------------------------
## New features and enhancements

 ### [Expandable section with inline "show more/less" action](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/expandable-section#truncate-expansion)

![expandable section with truncated text](./img/expandable-truncate.png)

 Adds the ability to truncate a block of text and allow the user to display the full content upon clicking "Show more."

 * [Search input - expandable masthead variant](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7380) - adding a variant of the search input that can be used in the masthead and expanded or collapsed inline with other elements.

 * [Checkbox - add ability to indicate they are required](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7830) - want to add the ability to add the required indicator (red asterisk) to a checkbox label. This is useful when the user must acknowledge certain information (e.g. terms and conditions) before proceeding.

 * [PageSection - add ability to specify HTML elements via props](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7419) - add an additional prop to PageSection that allows users to specify the underlying HTML element used, similar to Card and other components.

## What weâ€™re working on...

### 2022.13 (October 7)

* [Overflow menu - set breakpoint relative to container width](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7376) - responsive breakpoints are typically based on viewport width. This enhancement will update the [Overflow menu](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/overflow-menu) component to send overflow elements to the overflow menu when its container is resized.

* [Plain read-only form input](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/issues/7930) - adds the option to place a read-only input into a form that has styling similar to [description list](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/description-list/) items (no background or borders).


### 2022.14 (October 28)

* [Menu - add a danger state menu item](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/5057) - adds optional "danger" menu option styling to use for potentially destructive actions.

* [Sidebar - allow for custom content](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/4982) - this will allow for placing custom content in the left hand sidebar, below the navigation. This is difficult with the current implementation.
