# Beta components

Newly introduced components to the PatternFly component library are 
initially released in `beta`. Such components are labelled with a blue informational alert at the top of their documentation pages.

There are two recommended steps to take when considering using a beta component in product:
1. Play with the component examples in the docs and determine whether or not the current implementation meets your needs. Open issues for any missing features, enhancement requests, or bugs.
2. Check the [PatternFly Issues GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/patternfly/projects/7/views/5) where we have created a view to categorize most issues by component. Browse any open issues for the beta component to determine how much more the beta component could evolve in the near future.

Beta components are open to evolution and possible breaking changes 
pending testing and feedback. Each beta component is evaluated on a quarterly basis to evaluate its stability
and the degree to which it meets product requirements. Every quarter, stable
components are proposed as promotion candidates. 

Once promoted, breaking changes are not made to components outside of a well-advertised 
breaking change release. Breaking changes introduce visual changes, changes to applied CSS 
class names, or changes to existing React props (new React props might be added).

Occasionally, a component is promoted out of beta and subsequent enhancement requests require new CSS class names
and React props to be introduced. Whenever these enhancements are substantial enough to open the possibility
for further updates pending testing and feedback, then the newly introduced CSS class names or React props 
as well as relevant examples in the documentation are all labeled as beta.
