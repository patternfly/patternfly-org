### [Data list: selectableRow prop](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/data-list#datalist)
Using the `selectableRow` property causes the data list to render hidden inputs in its selectable rows. This improve selectable item accessibility.

### [Dual list selector](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/dual-list-selector)
A dual list selector allows users to select and move items from one list of available items to another list of selected items. Unlike a select list, a dual list selector separates the available options and the selected options into two separate lists, which allows users to easily scan the items they selected.

### [Icon sprites](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/form-control#icon-sprite)
The icons for the success, invalid, calendar, etc varations in form control elemements are applied as background images to the form element. By default, the image URLs for these icons are data URIs. However, there may be cases where data URIs are not ideal, such as in an application with a content security policy that disallows data URIs for security reasons. The .pf-m-icon-sprite variation changes the icon source to an external SVG file that serves as a sprite for all of the supported icons.

### [Label group](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/label-group)
Use a label group when you have multiple labels to display at once. Label groups can be oriented either horizontally or vertically and can optionally be named and dismissible.

A masthead contains global properties such as logotype, navigation and settings in an organized fashion and it is accessible from all parts of the application. All pages should share a common masthead.

### [Menu toggle](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/menu-toggle)

### [Notification drawer](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/notification-drawer)

### [Popover: alert severity, icon](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/popover#alert-popover)

### [Select: view more, loading variant](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/select#view-more)
When a select list contains more than 20 items, and the processing load may be too big to load all options at once, you have the option to add a “View more” link at the bottom of the menu. When the user clicks View more, more options are loaded and “view more” is replaced with the next available set of options.
