### [Data list: selectableRow prop](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/data-list#datalist)
Using the `selectableRow` property causes the data list to render hidden inputs in its selectable rows. This improve selectable item accessibility.

### [Dual list selector](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/dual-list-selector)
A dual list selector allows users to select and move items from one list of available items to another list of selected items. Unlike a select list, a dual list selector separates the available options and the selected options into two separate lists, which allows users to easily scan the items they selected.

### [Icon sprites](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/form-control#icon-sprite)
The icons for the success, invalid, calendar, etc varations in form control elemements are applied as background images to the form element. By default, the image URLs for these icons are data URIs. However, there may be cases where data URIs are not ideal, such as in an application with a content security policy that disallows data URIs for security reasons. The .pf-m-icon-sprite variation changes the icon source to an external SVG file that serves as a sprite for all of the supported icons.

### [Label group](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/label-group)
Use a label group when you have multiple labels to display at once. Label groups can be oriented either horizontally or vertically and can optionally be named and dismissible.
