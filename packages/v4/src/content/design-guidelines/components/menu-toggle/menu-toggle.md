The **menu toggle** component pairs with the menu component to create composable dropdown and select menus. Using a menu toggle with a menu enables you to create custom component configurations not supported by the standard dropdown or select components. However, from a design perspective, the dropdown, select, and menu toggle components are all visually the same. For more information about this components usage, see the [dropdown](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/dropdown/design-guidelines), [select](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/select/design-guidelines), and [menu](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/menu/design-guidelines) component guidelines.
