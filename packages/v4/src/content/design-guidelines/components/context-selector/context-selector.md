A **context selector** can be used in addition to global navigation when the data or resources you show in the interface need to change depending on the usersâ€™ context.

## Usage

Context selectors enable a user to switch between different application contexts, like administrator and regular user view, for example.

They can be placed in the page masthead, or at the top of vertical navigations, depending on your website or product's navigation and preference.
