A **card** is a square or rectangular container that can contain any kind of content. Cards symbolize units of information, and each one acts as an entry point for users to access more details. For example, in dashboards and catalog views, cards function as a preview of a detailed page. Cards may also be used in data displays like card views, or for positioning content on a page.  

## Elements

A card usually consists of 3 parts:

1. **Header**: Title of the information group
2. **Body**: Brief details about the group
3. **Footer**: Links to access more information about the group

Cards are flexible, and you can customize them in a variety of ways. A card can contain:
- A header with an image, actions, and a body.
- Only a header and a body.
- A header with an image, a body, and footer.

PatternFly supports three types of cards:
1. **Compact (recommended):** Compact cards use 16px spacing with an 8px spacer between the header and body and 16px between the body and footer.
2. **Standard:** Standard cards use 24px spacing with a 16px spacer between the header and body and 24px between the body and footer.
3. **Large:**

**Add expandable cards**

## Card usage
Use a card:
- To visually group content or distinguish information from the rest of a pageâ€™s content. Examples include dashboards and catalog views.
- To organize content in layouts with multiple columns or grids.  
- To compare separate groups of information.  
- To make media such as images and videos easier to scan.

Do NOT use a card to show a dense amount of repetitive, related content. Use a list or table view instead.
