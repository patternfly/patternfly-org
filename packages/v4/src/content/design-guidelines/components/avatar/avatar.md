An **avatar** is a visual used to represent a user. It may contain an image or a placeholder graphic.

## Usage

There are four size variations available to use for different scenarios. The typical usage for an avatar is to represent the current user in the masthead. However, based on your product's use cases and needs, there is room for customization.


### Small (24 px)
This size variation should be used in components such as accordions, data lists, tables, etc.
