A **badge** is used to annotate other information like a label or an object name. 

## Usage

Badges are typically used to reflect counts like number of objects, number of events, or number of unread items. If you need a selectable annotation consider using a [label](/components/label) instead.

They are often found in filter toggles to indicate the number of selections that have been made in a toolbar filter or select list. Please refer to the 
[select list documentation](/components/select/design-guidelines#checkbox-select) for more examples.
