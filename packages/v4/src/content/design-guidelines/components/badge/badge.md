A **badge** is used to annotate other information like a label or an object name. 

## Usage

Badges are typically used to reflect a count, like number of objects, number of events and number of unread items, for example.

They are often found in filter toggles to indicate the number of selections that have been made in a toolbar filter, or select list. Please refer to the 
[select list documentation](/components/select/design-guidelines#checkbox-select) for more examples.
