**Form select** is used to embed browser native select lists into a form.

## Usage

If your use case only calls for simple selects, you may opt to use a form select as an field inside a form. However, if your use case requires more customization and capability, use a PatternFly [custom select list](/components/select/react). **Note** that for the sake of maintaining visual consistency in the UI, you should not use custom selects and form selects together in the same context.
