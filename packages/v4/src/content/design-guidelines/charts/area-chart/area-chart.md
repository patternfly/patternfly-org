An **area chart** is used to provide metrics for a single data point. While similar to a line chart in both form and function, it offers an area fill for visual emphasis. The area fill below the line also functions to indicate cumulative data.

## Usage
The most common use case for area charts is to show trending over a continuous scale (usually time). Use this chart type when you need to provide more visual emphasis than a simple [line chart](/charts/line-chart) offers. 

You may stack area charts to compare more than one continuous data sets. Stacking area charts will put more emphasis on the difference between each visualized data set. 

### Example
<img src="./img/area-chart.png" alt="Area chart" width="489"/>Â 

1. **Data area fill:** The area fill is presented below the data line. Data area fills use colors that conform with the [volors for charts](/guidelines/colors-for-charts).
2. **Chart tooltip:** Use the chart tooltip to drill into the data related to any data point provided on your area chart.
