Use the second person "you/your" whenever you can. This way, your focus is on the user, and the product interaction feels more like a conversation.

Use the first person "I" when the user is agreeing to something. For example, a user can check a box reading, “I agree to the terms and conditions.”

Try to avoid using third person "he/she/they/it." Third person sounds formal and disconnected from the user.

<table style="table-layout: fixed" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center><strong>Before</strong></center></th>
        <th><center><strong>After</strong></center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Users can simplify their designs with PatternFly.</td>
        <td>Simplify your designs with PatternFly.</td>
    </tr>

Use the active voice whenever possible. The active voice makes a sentence shorter and gets the point across faster.

The active voice is when the subject of the sentence performs the action. The passive voice is when the subject of the sentence receives the action.

<table style="table-layout: fixed" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center><strong>Before</strong></center></th>
        <th><center><strong>After</strong></center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The book is being read by Matt.</td>
        <td>Matt is reading the book.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

There are some occasions when the [passive voice is appropriate](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/ccs_activevoice/), like when you don’t wish to point out a subject or when you want to emphasize an action. Also, use the passive voice to avoid assigning blame to a user, especially in error messages.

<table style="table-layout: fixed" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center><strong>Before</strong></center></th>
        <th><center><strong>After</strong></center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>You entered the wrong password.</td>
        <td>The password is incorrect.</td>
    </tr>
