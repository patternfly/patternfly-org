## Ampersand
Avoid using ampersands, and use "and" instead.

## Referring to text in the UI
Use bold text (not quotation marks) when referring to an element or text in the UI.

<table style="table-layout: fixed" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center><strong>Before</strong></center></th>
        <th><center><strong>After</strong></center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Add user to the “Group title” team </td>
        <td>Add user to the <b>Group title</b> team</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br /> 

## Commas
When a conjunction connects two independent clauses, a comma should precede it. Also put a comma before “and” if it’s the Oxford comma.

Examples:
- *I like to run, and I like to swim* — A comma is needed before “and” because “and” connects two independent clauses.
- *I like to run and swim* — A comma is not needed before “and” because “and” does not connect two independent clauses.
- *I like to run, swim, and hike* — The Oxford comma is included before “and.”

## Ellipses (...)
Ellipses (...) are commonly used when information is omitted. You might use ellipses when you cannot fit all words onto a line or when you remove less relevant information (like in a quote).

<table style="table-layout: fixed" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center><strong>Before ellipses</strong></center></th>
        <th><center><strong>After ellipses</strong></center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>They said, “For many reasons, I think the PatternFly community is great.”</td>
        <td>They said, “...I think the PatternFly community is great.”</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br /> 

Ellipses can also be used in more creative contexts to signify someone’s thoughts or speech, like a pause for thinking.

Example:

But I was just trying to...never mind, forget it.

## Em dash, en dash, hyphen
Use an **em dash (—)** to add emphasis to the phrase or sentence following it. You can also use an em dash to provide additional information or specification in the middle of a sentence.

Examples:
- Good design is not about you—it’s about the user.
- I like drinking something hot—coffee, tea, or cocoa—during my morning meetings.

Use an **en dash ( – )** to separate numbers in a series.

Example:
We plan on having 100–150 attendees.

Use a **hyphen ( - )** for compound adjectives or words, names, and titles. You should also use a hyphen for certain prefixes, like “ex.”

Examples:
- My name is Mary-Jane.
- They write high-quality content.
- She is self-assured.
- He is my ex-husband.

## Exclamation mark
Use exclamation marks sparingly. Don’t use one to generate excitement; only use an exclamation mark if the user is actually experiencing something exciting. You can also use an exclamation mark for something cautionary, like “Stop!” or “Watch out!”

To more accurately capture human expression, use an exclamation mark after just a few words, not after a long sentence.

<table style="table-layout: fixed" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center><strong>Before</strong></center></th>
        <th><center><strong>After</strong></center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Congratulations on creating an account!</td>
        <td>Congratulations! You created an account.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br />

## Parallel structure
All items in a list or series should be of the same part of speech.

<table style="table-layout: fixed" tr width="80%">
    <tr>
        <th><center><strong>Before</strong></center></th>
        <th><center><strong>After</strong></center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Remember these important tips: Write clearly; conduct research; spelling and grammar.</td>
        <td>Remember these important tips: Write clearly; conduct research; use correct spelling and grammar.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br />

## Parentheses 
Do not use parentheses to indicate a possible plural of something, like "Account(s)." If a user can select one thing or multiple things, use the plural form.

## Quotation marks
Use double quotation marks (“Example”) for quotes and article titles. Use single quotation marks (‘Example’) for quotes or article titles within double quotation marks.

Double quotation marks and single quotation marks are sometimes used interchangeably across various publications. In some contexts, they can mean the same thing. Double quotation marks are the standard in American English, and single quotation marks are usually the standard in British English.

But double and single quotation marks are not always interchangeable, particularly when you need to use quotation marks within quotation marks. In this case, single quotation marks are used inside of double quotation marks.

Examples:
- An article title within a dialogue:  *Abi said, “I love the article Cat wrote. It’s called ‘Improving product design with an open source mindset,’ and it’s such a fun read.”*
- A quote within a dialogue: *“I like Cat’s article too, Abi. My co-worker told me, ‘PatternFly has the best publication ever.’ That made me smile.”*

## Semicolon and colon
Use a colon to introduce a list or a series. You can also use it as a pause before introducing related information.

Use a semicolon to connect two closely related independent clauses. You can also use a semicolon instead of a comma to separate long list items for extra clarity.

Examples:
- That leads me to my favorite hobby: running.
- I love running in the morning; it wakes me up.
- Every morning, I enjoy eating toast, bacon, and eggs; reading a book; and relaxing on the porch.

**Note**: If you're tempted to use a semicolon in the UI, try breaking up the sentence and cutting down on your words instead.
