## Abbreviations and acronyms
Use abbreviations that users are familiar with, and write out uncommon abbreviations. Abbreviate units of measurement, and use abbreviations consistently.

| **Abbreviation** | **Usage** |
|------------------|-----------|
| CSS | Stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>. Write <i>CSS</i> in all caps. |
| e.g., i.e., and etc. | Use sparingly. These terms aren’t easily understood by everyone, especially users whose native language is not rooted in Latin. Write out their meaning instead:<ul><li>e.g. – for example</li><li>i.e. – in other words</li><li>etc. – and more/so on</li></ul> |
| HTML | Stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>. Write <i>HTML</i> in all caps. |
| JS | Stands for <i>JavaScript</i>. Write <i>JS</i> in all caps. |
| K8 | Stands for <i>Kubernetes</i>. |
| KVM | Refers to a kernel-based virtual machine. Write <i>KVM</i> in all caps. |
| sysadmin | Avoid using abbreviations like <i>sysadmin</i> and <i>SysAdmin</i> because they’re too informal and not always easily understood. <i>System</i> should be singular (not <i>Systems administrator</i>) because it can include both a single system and multiple systems, similar to <i>brain surgeon</i>, who works on more than one brain.<br />Takenfrom Red Hat Corporate Style Guide. |
| U.S. | As a noun, use <i>United States</i> unless there are space constraints. As an adjective, use <i>U.S.</i> (for example, <i>U.S. soldier</i>). As part of an organization, use <i>U.S.</i><br />Takenfrom Red Hat Corporate Style Guide. | 
| URL | Stands for <i>Uniform Resource Locator</i>. Write <i>URL</i> in all caps. |
| VM | Refers to a virtual machine. OK to abbreviate as long as you've spelled it out once in the first occurrence and as long as <i>VM</i> won't be confused with other terms that share that acronym.<br />Takenfrom Red Hat Corporate Style Guide. |
| N/A | Refers to <i>data not available</i>. Applies to tables, list views, card views, and more. |
| -- | Refers to <i>data not applicable</i>, meaning data will never be available for the object (unlike <i>N/A</i>). |
