A **breadcrumb** provides page context to help users navigate more efficiently and understand where they are in the application hierarchy.

Most frequently, breadcrumb consists of many links which will use **Tab** to navigate through them, **Shift + Tab** to go backwards, and **Enter** to activate each link. 


In general, the breadcrumb component already has accessibility built in. However, if you would like to customize it, edit the following:

| React component| Prop or attribute | Which HTML element it appears on in markup | Explanation | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Breadcrumb | aria-label | .pf-c-breadcrumb | Label added to the breadcrumb nav |
