Red Hat managed extensions are maintained by the User Experience team at Red Hat. 
Each extension is a larger functional feature made of multiple PatternFly components, 
usually designed for a specific use case. The code lives in the PatternFly organization on Github. 
Each extension consumes up to date versions of PatternFly. Issues can be opened in GitHub against 
these projects' code bases.
