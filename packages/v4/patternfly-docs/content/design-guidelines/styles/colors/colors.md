## Contrast ratios
<p>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/" target="_blank" className="pf-m-link">Level AA in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1</a> requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, and a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders).
</p>

Check color contrast between background color and text color using a <a href="https://color.a11y.com/?wc3" target="_blank" className="pf-m-link">WCAG AA-compliance tool.</a>

Make sure that, on hover, link texts provides ample contrast from both background color and from the default state of link text.

## Color palette
Our palettes are created as a system designed to reinforce application content and workflows. Bright colors are reserved for specific interactions such as reinforcing status and are used sparingly. Our palettes are simple and consolidated to allow them to be easily deployed and versatile for any situation.
