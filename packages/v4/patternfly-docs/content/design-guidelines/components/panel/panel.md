The **panel** component is a container that supports flexible content layouts. It can be used to house other components such as fields, forms, videos, buttons, and more. The panel should not be confused with the <a href="https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/drawer/design-guidelines/">drawer</a> component, which allows you to surface information via a collapsable container.

## Usage
Panels are commonly used:
- To provide more content structure through the UI.
- To group content and components on a blank canvas.
