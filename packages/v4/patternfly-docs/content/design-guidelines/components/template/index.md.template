<!--
Welcome and thanks for contributing to PatternFly's design guidelines! We created this template to help writers contribute content that's useful for our PatternFly users and consistent with our existing content and standards.

When writing design guidelines, keep in the mind - there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to every design problem; that’s why PatternFly 4 was built to be modular and flexible.

Design guidelines should help PatternFly 4 users understand the rationale behind our design decisions and build a solution that works to solve their specific design problem.

For example, should I use a toast alert or an inline alert? Should I use a warning alert or an informational alert? How do I write a good alert message? Which components can my team use to build this design pattern?

Our design guidelines should answer all of these questions and more.

Thanks again for your contribution and be sure to reach out to us in GitHub or on Slack with any questions. -->


_Include a short (1-2 sentence) description of the component here and fill out the following sections as needed_

## Primary elements
_Provide an overview of the primary elements that can be used to build the design pattern you’re documenting.

For example, you can use data inputs, text inputs, select lists, and buttons to build a form, but you won’t always need to use all of these elements.

An element can be a component, like a button, or something smaller that you want to call out, like a button label.

You can use one or more images to identify the elements you’re describing._


## Usage
_(Required)
Inform readers about when and how this component or pattern should be used, including any variations or related best practices._
* What are the different variations of this design pattern?
* What problem does this solve?
* When should I use this pattern?
* When should I avoid this pattern?
* Alternative solutions?
* How to use this in context (in my design)
    * Layout or sizing considerations
    * How to use with other components or patterns
    * Examples

## Behavior
_(Optional)
You can include behavioral specifications to help readers understand any complex aspects of behavior that might not be obvious from the implementation examples.
This will aid readers in understanding aspects of behavior that may not be
obvious from looking at implementation examples._
* Include mockups (can be low or mid-fi) with enumerated callouts to describe intended interactions.
* Mockups can be low or mid-fi.

## Styling
_(Optional)
If there are styling considerations that may not be obvious from looking at the implementation examples, they should be explained here._

## Content
_(optional)
Provide content standards and writing suggestions for this component or pattern to help designers and developers deliver consistent and thoughtful content. You can include guidelines, messaging standards, or similar best practices specific to this component or pattern.This will extend any general terminology and wording best practices to provide component specific guidance._
* Editorial guidelines for labeling and message text
* Length restrictions and/or what to do if text overflows
* Localization considerations
