## Usage

If your use case only calls for simple selects, you may opt to use a form select as an field inside a form. However, if your use case requires more customization and capability, use a PatternFly [custom select list](/components/select/react). 

**Note**: Use only custom selects or only form selects in the same context. Mixing them together compromises visual consistency in your UI.
