A **title** component applies top and bottom margins, font-weight, font-size, and line-height to titles. The most common usage for a title is to define headings within a page. For more information about the relationship between title component sizes and HTML heading levels, see the [Typography guidelines](/guidelines/typography#customizing-heading-levels).
