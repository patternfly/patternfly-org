The **clipboard copy** component allows users to quickly and easily copy content to their clipboard.

Clipboard copy uses native keyboard interaction with **Tab** navigating between interactive elements, **Shift + Tab** going backwards, and **Enter** activating the toggle or clipboard copy button. The screen reader experience, likewise, will mostly be based on native interaction expectations.

In general, the clipboard copy component already has accessibility built in. HHowever, if youâ€™d like to customize it, edit the following:

| React component| React prop | Which HTML element it appears on in markup | Explanation | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ClipboardCopy | textAriaLabel | .pf-c-form-control input | Aria-label to use on the TextInput. |
| ClipboardCopy | toggleAriaLabel | .pf-c-button expanded toggle | Aria-label to use on the ClipboardCopyToggle. |
| ClipboardCopyButton | aria-label | .pf-c-button copy button | Aria-label for the copy button. |
