## Accessibility

To implement an accessible PatternFly **banner**:

- Check the color contrast of a banner and any text on it to make sure they can be read by users with color blindness or other visual impairments.
- When a banner is used to convey status, add an icon that also conveys status visually, and provide screen reader text using `.pf-screen-reader` or an equivalent.

## Testing

At a minimum, a banner should meet the following criteria:

<List isPlain>
  <ListItem>
    <Checkbox id="banner-a11y-checkbox-1" label="A user should not be able to focus on the banner with keyboard controls." />
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Checkbox id="banner-a11y-checkbox-2" label="A user should be able to have a screen reader describe the contents of the banner, but not focus on or interact with the banner otherwise." />
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    <Checkbox id="banner-a11y-checkbox-3" label={<span>If the banner conveys status, a status icon and <code className="ws-code">.pf-screen-reader</code> element is included.</span>} />
  </ListItem>
</List>

## React customization

The following React props have been provided for more fine-tuned control over accessibility.

| Prop | Applied to | Reason |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `screenReaderText` | `Banner` | Adds text that is accessible only to assistive technologies and is not visually rendered. This prop should only be passed in when the banner is meant to convey status. |

## HTML/CSS customization

The following HTML attributes and PatternFly classes can be used for more fine-tuned control over accessibility.

| Attribute or class | Applied to | Reason | 
|---|---|---|
| `.pf-screen-reader` | `span` | Provides an accessible description of the type of banner. **Required if banner conveys status** |
