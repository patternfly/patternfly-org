An **action list** is a group of actions with set spacing.
 
**Keyboard users** should be able to navigate an action list using **Tab** to move forward and **Tab + Shift** to move backwards through interactive elements. They should be able to select a focused action using **Space** or **Enter**.
 
**Screen reader users** should be able to navigate to the actions on the action list, and they should have text that can be read by a screen reader, or alternative text if they only contain an icon. For alternative text, `aria-label` is the most common choice.

## To make action list accessible:
- Ensure the list is navigable using a keyboard
- Use alternative text if actions do not have their own text that a screen reader can read
