A **brand** is used to place a product logotype on a screen.

**Keyboard users** should not be able to focus on the brand, as it is not interactive.

**Screen reader users** should be able to navigate to the brand and have a screen reader read the brandâ€™s descriptive text.

The following props/attributes have been added for you or are customizable in PatternFly:

| React prop | React component it should be applied to | Which HTML element it appears on in markup | Reason used |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| alt | Brand | `.pf-c-brand` | Descriptive alternative text for the image of the Brand |
