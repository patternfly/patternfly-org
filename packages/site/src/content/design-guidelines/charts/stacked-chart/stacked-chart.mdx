A **stacked bar chart** describes totals while allowing a degree of internal breakdown of its data. Stacked bar charts can be illustrated vertically and horizontally depending on available space and the described data.

## Usage 
An advantageous feature of stacked bar charts is the ability to reorder the stacked bars without changing the chart's overall total.

#### Example
<img src="./img/horizontal-stacked-bar-chart.png" alt="Horizontal stacked bar chart" width="690"/>

<br/>

<img src="./img/vertical-stacked-bar-chart.png" alt="Vertical stacked bar chart" width="663"/>

The first series name is represented by the topmost stacked bar, and the last series name is represented by the bottommost stacked bar. For recommendations on series colors, see [colors for charts](/charts/colors-for-charts).
