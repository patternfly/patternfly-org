# About PatternFly 4
PatternFly is an open source design system that was created to enable consistency and usability across a wide range of applications and use cases. PatternFly provides clear standards, guidance, and tools to help designers and developers work together more efficiently to build better products and user experiences.

## Basic structure
PatterFly 4 is separated into isolated and modular structures that fall into two categories: layouts and components.

### Layouts
Layouts are generic tools that allow you to structure and organize the content on your pages.

### Components
Components, like buttons and alerts, can be assembled together to build applications.

## Style and design
### Styles
Styles define foundational elements of the design system like color, typography, and spacing.

### Design guidelines
PatternFly design guidelines communicate design standards and best practices for common patterns like navigation, dashboards, or forms.

## Additional tools
### Demos
Demos demonstrate (see what we did there?) how components and layouts can be combined to build more complex structures like dashboards.

### Utilities
Since PatternFly 4 is made up of isolated components that don't allow dependencies, the use of helpers is discouraged.

However, you might run into a situation where you need custom styling. Utilities are a set of classes that enable you to customize and modify elements in your project without having to write any custom CSS.

For example, you might use a utility class to add additional spacing between elements, align content in a layout, or even add a box shadow to an element.

### Variables
You can further customize PatternFly using the CSS variable system, which enables you to easily change things like color or shape without overwriting existing PatternFly styles. <Learn more about customizing with the variable system.>

Flexibility
PatternFly 4 was built to be flexible and is scoped to work in tandem with other design systems. This means you’re able to use PatternFly 4 components alongside components from systems like Bootstrap, Material.io, or older versions of PatternFly.

For example, our code is written like pf-c-alert
