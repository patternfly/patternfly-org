If you're a developer, [check out our getting started page](/get-started/developers#using-styles) to learn more about how to get and use our icon set.

## All icons
PatternFly uses custom icons and selections from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons). PatternFly icons are two dimensional and flat. Most of the icons are gray with the exception of icons that require color or emphasis. 

The icons you see on this page are a subset of available PatternFly icons. Click on any icon to download or copy a code snippet. To use an icon in your desktop applications, you can install the [PatternFlyIcons-webfont.ttf](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/blob/master/src/patternfly/assets/pficon/pficon.ttf), set it as the font in your application, and paste the icons into your designs.
