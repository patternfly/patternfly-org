<p>Before you begin, check out <a href="/get-started/about">About PatternFly 4</a> to get acquainted with the basic elements of the design system.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-3xl pf-u-mt-xl">Get set up</h1>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-2xl pf-u-mt-xl">Download and install the PatterFly 4 design kit</h1>

<p>The design kit is a collection of assets that make it easy for you to create high-fidelity design mockups using PatternFly 4 components.</p>

<p>The design kit works with Sketch libraries and templates. To use it, you'll need to have <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> version 47 or above.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Download the design kit files:</h1>
<p><b>Add the Sketch library</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Access the <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/wxoZ9">PatternFly 4 design library</a> on Sketch cloud.</li>
<li>Click <b>Add library to Sketch</b> on the bottom right to add the library. You'll be prompted with a modal. Click <b>Add library to Sketch</b> again. Sketch will show you the library in your preferences window. You're all set!</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Add the Sketch template</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Access the <div class="link"><a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/wxydj">PatternFly 4 design template</a> on Sketch cloud.</li>
<li>Click <b>Download Document</b> on the bottom right to add the library.</li>
<li>Navigate to the file you just downloaded, <code>PatternFly 4 Template.sketch</code>, and open it.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>File > Save as Template...</code> and name your file whatever makes sense to you. We recommend something simple like <code>PatternFly 4</code>." You can now access the PatternFly 4 template from <code>File > New from Template...</code>.</li>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-3xl pf-u-mt-xl">Start designing</h1>

<p>PatternFly is made up of modular components that can be assembled in a variety of ways to build applications and interfaces, along with styles, standards, and design guidelines to help you choose and use the right components for your project.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Start with styles</h1>

<p>What typography should you be using? What about colors? Spacing? Check out styles to learn everything you need to know about our foundational design elements.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Get familiar with usage and behavior guidelines</h1>

<p>Should you use a wizard or a form to solve this problem? How do you write a good button label? Which navigation makes the most sense? Check out our design guidelines to choose and use the right components for your use case.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Start building with components</h1>

<p>What does a toolbar look like? What about a filter chip? Components are the building blocks of the design system. Check out individual component pages to view examples, understand states and behavior, and check out the code samples (if you’re into that kind of thing).</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Still feeling unsure? See all the pieces working together with demos.</h1>


<p>What does it look like when you combine all the ingredients? Demos provide examples of a few common ways you might combine layouts and components to give you an idea what’s possible.</p>

The PatternFly 4 Design Kit is a collection of assets that make it easy for you to create high-fidelity design mockups using PatternFly 4 components.

**Before you start**
You need [Sketch](URL) (v47 or higher) installed. The PatternFly 4 design kit works with Sketch libraries. To use libraries, you’ll need Sketch version 47 or above. Why Sketch? It’s the industry standard for design tooling and it makes our lives easier.

**Add PatternFly 4 to your Sketch library:**
1. Open Sketch.
2. Navigate to ```Sketch > Preferences``` and open the Libraries tab.
Click Add library.
3. Navigate to the directory you copied the design kit files to and select the file PatternFly ?.sketch. PatternFly styles are added to your library.

**Add PatternFly 4 as a template:**
1. From your PatternFly design kit directory, use Sketch to open the file PatternFly Template.sketch
2. In Sketch, select ```File > Save as template```.
3. **Start using the design kit!** That’s it - you’re all set to start using PatternFly 4 in your designs. -->
