# Design with PatternFly
Before you begin, check out [About PatternFly 4](/get-started/about) to get acquainted with the basic elements of the design system.

## Designing with PatternFly 4
PatternFly is made up of modular components that can be assembled in a variety of ways to build applications and interfaces, along with styles, standards, and design guidelines to help you choose and use the right components for your project.

### Start with styles.
What typography should you be using? What about colors? Spacing? Check out styles to learn everything you need to know about our foundational design elements.

[View styles](/design-guidelines/styles/icons)

### Get familiar with usage and behavior guidelines.
Should you use a wizard or a form to solve this problem? How do you write a good button label? Which navigation makes the most sense? Check out our design guidelines to choose and use the right components for your use case.

### Start building with components.
What does a toolbar look like? What about a filter chip? Components are the building blocks of the design system. Check out individual component pages to view examples, understand states and behavior, and check out the code samples (if you’re into that kind of thing).

### Still feeling unsure? See all the pieces working together with demos.
What does it look like when you combine all the ingredients? Demos provide examples of a few common ways you might combine layouts and components to give you an idea what’s possible.

### Download and install the PatterFly 4 design kit
The PatternFly 4 Design Kit is a collection of assets that make it easy for you to create high-fidelity design mockups using PatternFly 4 components.

**Before you start**
You need [Sketch](URL) (v47 or higher) installed. The PatternFly 4 design kit works with Sketch libraries. To use libraries, you’ll need Sketch version 47 or above. Why Sketch? It’s the industry standard for design tooling and it makes our lives easier.

**Download the design kit files:**
1. Go to the design kit repo.
2. Complete the following step for files PatternFly 4.sketch and PatternFly Template.sketch
    * Click on the file name and then click **View Raw**. The files will be downloaded to your local machine. You can move the files to any directory that makes sense to you.

**Add PatternFly 4 to your Sketch library:**
1. Open Sketch.
2. Navigate to ```Sketch > Preferences``` and open the Libraries tab.
Click Add library.
3. Navigate to the directory you copied the design kit files to and select the file PatternFly ?.sketch. PatternFly styles are added to your library.

**Add PatternFly 4 as a template:**
1. From your PatternFly design kit directory, use Sketch to open the file PatternFly Template.sketch
2. In Sketch, select ```File > Save as template```.
3. **Start using the design kit!** That’s it - you’re all set to start using PatternFly 4 in your designs. -->
