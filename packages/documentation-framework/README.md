# @patternfly/documentation-framework

## The PatternFly documentation framework lets you develop component examples in markdown format, so that they can be added to [patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/).

## Install

We publish this theme [on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/documentation-framework) Install it as a devDependency with your package manager.

1. @patternfly/documentation-framework

    `npm i --save-dev @patternfly/documentation-framework`

    or

    `yarn add -D @patternfly/documentation-framework`

2. Provide or install the following either as dependencies if you want to use them in your own project, or as devDependencies:
    ```
    "@patternfly/patternfly": "^4.185.1",
    "@patternfly/react-core": "^4.202.16",
    "@patternfly/react-table": "^4.71.16",
    "@patternfly/react-code-editor": "^4.43.16",
    ```
    `yarn add -D @patternfly/patternfly @patternfly/react-core @patternfly/react-table @patternfly/react-code-editor`

### Resolutions

This should not be needed, but if you encounter errors installing the above devDependencies, try adding one or more of these resolutions to your package.json file:
```
"resolutions": {
  "@types/react": "^16.8.0",
  "@types/react-dom": "^16.8.0",
  "react": "16.8.0",
  "react-dom": "16.8.0",
  "chromedriver": "102.0.0",
  "node-sass": "7.0.1",
  "puppeteer": "14.3.0",
  "sharp": "0.30.6"
}
```

## First time setup

### Puppeteer

Puppeteer is used to create screenshots, it requires chromium to be installed on your machine

- install chromium using brew:

  `brew install chromium`
- check the chromium path, should point to /opt/homebrew/bin/chromium:

  `which chromium`
- export out the path:

  export PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true

  export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=\`which chromium\`

- So you don't have to retype this in the future, save to your shell rc file like .bashrc or .zshrc:

  echo 'export PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true' >> ~/.zshrc

  echo 'export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=\`which chromium\`' >> ~/.zshrc 

### Init documentation project

To get started, you can scaffold out a sample extension docs setup:

`npx pf-docs-framework init --name "My extension"`

If you also want to add relevant script targets to package.json, pass in `--scripts` as well:

`npx pf-docs-framework init --name "My extension" --scripts`

## Usage

For all CLI options, run `npx pf-docs-framework --help`

For individual CLI commands, you can also display more information by running `npx pf-docs-framework <COMMAND> --help`

### Develop docs

`yarn docs:develop`

or

`npx pf-docs-framework start`

### Build docs

`yarn docs:build`

or

`npx pf-docs-framework build all --output public`

> NOTE: If you have `sideEffects: false` in your package.json, that will prevent the CSS from loading in the documentation production build. Set it to true or remove it to enable the CSS from being loaded.

### Generate screenshots

You can generate screenshots against development or production builds.

- Development:

  Terminal 1:

  `yarn docs:develop` or `npx pf-docs-framework start` (Take note of the port it started on, you can modify it in patternfly-docs.config)

  Terminal 2:

  `yarn docs:screenshots` or `npx pf-docs-framework screenshots --urlPrefix http://localhost:<PORT>`

- Production:

  Terminal 1:
  
  - `yarn docs:build` or `npx pf-docs-framework build all --output public`
  - `yarn docs:serve` or `npx pf-docs-framework serve public --port 5000`

  Terminal 2:

  `yarn docs:screenshots` or `npx pf-docs-framework screenshots --urlPrefix http://localhost:5000`

  ### Publish docs to patternfly.org

  1. Include the `patternfly-docs/content` and `patternfly-docs/generated` folders as part of your npm published module

  2. Create a PR at [patternfly-org](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org) to bundle in the package's examples so that they're part of the patternfly.org documentation.
