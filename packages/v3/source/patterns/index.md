UI Patterns are interaction design solutions that can be applied consistently to solve a class of problems. They are based on an understanding of the use cases for multiple applications and /or domains. Patterns generally include: overview of the task flow; references to UI components; customizations; and criteria for use. They are delivered as documentation that includes interaction design recommendations and design examples. Using the PatternFly UI patterns promotes user experience consistency. Consistency supports product learn-ability, by not forcing users to “relearn” the experience for each application. It makes adopting and using enterprise IT applications easier for users.

Browse the patterns below to find out what&#8217;s included in the PatternFly library.  Don&#8217;t see what you are looking for? The UI pattern library is built out of contributions from interaction designers who have volunteered their time to contribute to the PatternFly project. [Learn how you can become a contributor][1].
