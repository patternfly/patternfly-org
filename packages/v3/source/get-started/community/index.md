## Contribute

### File an Issue
Before filing an issue, check the list of open issues against [our GitHub repositories][9]. When you create an issue, include as many details as possible, use a clear and descriptive title, and remember that an image is worth a thousand words, so try to add images and links when possible.

### Proposing or Modifying a Design
Propose a new pattern, add an enhancement to an existing pattern, or help us fix  existing documentation issues. All design and documentation changes are submitted and managed through our [Design Repo][10]. Visit [How to Contribute to PatternFly Design][11] for more information. 

### Contributing code
Both developers and designers review PRs, so if you are committing a new design or modifying an existing design, be sure to add a link to a graphic or a working version on rawgit so that designers can preview the request.

Whenever possible, provide a link to the design documentation or specification that supported the development of the code. The PR will be reviewed by the community, and once itâ€™s approved by two people from the team it  can  be merged.
