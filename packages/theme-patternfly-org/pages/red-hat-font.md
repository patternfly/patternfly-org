## Global font changes

- The Red Hat font has 2 variations ("text" and "display"), and this PR adds font families for both variations. Each font variation was designed with specific characteristics which allow them to perform best in their specific contexts. For more information, see the \[RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont repo\](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont/).

- "RedHatText": uses a smaller/lighter character with hinting that enables it to fit the pixel grid well at smaller sizes like body text.

- `--pf-global--FontFamily--redhatfont--sans-serif`
- Font weights

- 400 (normal)
- 700 (bold)

- "RedHatDisplay": uses a wider/heavier character which matches our logo and is designed to be used for headings and other large sizes.

- `--pf-global--FontFamily--redhatfont--heading--sans-serif`
- Font weights

- 300 (light - rarely used)
- 400 (normal)
- 700 (bold)

- Adds new global variable for use with RedHatDisplay

- `--pf-global--FontFamily--heading--sans-serif`

- No longer using a semi-bold font weight with RedHatDisplay/RedHatText
- Adds new variable for "bold" for use with RedHatDisplay/RedHatText since the bold value was 600 with Overpass, and is now 700 with RedHatDisplay/RedHatText

- `--pf-global--FontWeight--redhatfont--bold`

- Changes the value for `--pf-global--FontSize--xl` from 21px to 20px

- Works better on a mathematical scale for relative sizing

### Existing overrides

With the CSS changes listed above, each change is defined in a `.pf-m-redhat-font` selector in the PatternFly CSS. That means that these variable overrides and new declarations are all in selectors that have a CSS specificity of 10 higher than they would normally.

For example, the existing selector in PatternFly below has a specificity of 10:

`.pf-c-title { --pf-c-title--m-lg--FontWeight: var(--pf-global--FontWeight--normal); }` 

When opting-in to the new font, that variable is now overridden as below, and the selector has a specificity of 20:

`.pf-m-redhat-font .pf-c-title { --pf-c-title--m-lg--FontWeight: var(--pf-global--FontWeight--normal); }`

So in your application, if you had overridden `--pf-c-title--m-lg--FontWeight` in your own CSS by defining your override after PatternFly’s CSS in the loading order and using a selector that has the same specificity as the original rule (10) from PatternFly, you will now need to increase the specificity of your override’s rule to match or exceed 20 for your override to still apply after opting-in to the new font.
