**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is transforming experiences, enabling more personalized, efficient, and innovative digital interactions. When used thoughtfully and intentionally, AI can enhance the user experience of products designed with PatternFly. 

To guide the use of AI in design practices, we have developed AI-driven design principles and guidelines that consider how:

- The way that we design is just as important as what we design.
- AI experiences can impact people in both desired and undesired ways.

## AI principles 

These design principles build an ethics-first framework and guide the use of AI with PatternFly. AI systems should be: 
- Accountable. 
- Explainable.
- Transparent. 
- Fair. 
- Human-centered.

### Accountable
Clear responsibilities are defined for AI design, development, and deployment processes&mdash;including policies and the documentation of design decisions and processesâ€‹.

Accountability includes:

- **Accessible policies:** Company policies should be readily accessible to all team members.

- **Legal compliance:** All necessary laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines must be followed throughout the development process.

### Explainable
AI systems are easy to explain and comprehend. Our users can understand who is making decisions and how these decisions are made.

Explainability includes: 

- **Understandable outcomes:** To build trust and help users make use of AI conclusions, clear explanations of how these conclusions are reached should be provided.

### Transparent
Processes, decisions, and practices involved in AI systems are transparent.

Transparency includes: 

- **Transparent processes and decisions:** To help users understand intentions and decision-making methods, design processes and decisions should be well documented.

- **Data transparency:** Informed consent must be obtained to collect and use data. The ways that user data is collected, stored, and used should be shared.

### Fair
AI systems are inclusive, accessible, and do not amplify bias.

Fairness includes: 

- **Bias mitigation:** To prevent discriminatory outcomes, potential biases should be identified and reduced.

- **Inclusive design:** To avoid systemic bias, designs should be inclusive and accommodating of various user demographics.

- **Equal access:** Access to AI technologies should be available and beneficial to most users and communities.

### Human-centered 
AI systems are human-centered and focus on accessibility, transparency, and user empowerment. 

Human-centered design considers:

- **Value and need alignment:** AI systems should be aligned with user needs and values. They should be continuously refined based on user feedback and ethical considerations.

- **Cultural sensitivity:** Cultural differences should be considered and respected.

- **Data rights and control:** Users should have control over their data, including the ability to access, modify, and delete their information.

- **Privacy protection:** Personally identifiable information must be protected and used responsibly.

## Red Hat policies

If you are using PatternFly to design Red Hat products, adhere to AI-related policies that Red Hat has previously outlined. 

Currently, Red Hat:
- Requires approval before using AI technology for business related to Red Hat.
- Requires approval before certain information can be used as input for AI technology.
- Requires review, testing, and validation of generative AI model output.
- Provides a few exceptions to this policy.
