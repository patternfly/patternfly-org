The **level** layout is designed to distribute space evenly between sections of content and center them horizontally. 

## Elements

By default, level items are placed on the page horizontally and wrap. The level layout is not responsive, but items will wrap as the viewport is resized.

A level layout will contain:

1. **Level:** The level container, which holds all level items.
1. **Level item:** An individual section of content to be placed in the level container. 

## Usage

The level layout can be used to ensure that sections of content are neatly and evenly displayed across the width of a UI.

## Variations

To adjust spacing between items, you can apply gutters.
