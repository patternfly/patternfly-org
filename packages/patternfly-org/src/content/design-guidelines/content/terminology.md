## Abbreviations and acronyms
Use abbreviations that users are familiar with, and write out uncommon abbreviations. Only use an abbreviation that has already been established and *never* make up an abbreviation or acronym yourself to help keep consistency in your products. Make sure that your abbreviations are consistent, always abbreviate units of measurement, and, when referring to a product, default to how the company refers to it themselves. 

<div class="ws-content-table">

| **Abbreviation** | **Usage** |
|------------------|-----------|
| **CSS** | Stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. Write *CSS* in all caps. |
| **e.g.**, **i.e.**, and **etc.** | Use sparingly. These terms aren’t easily understood by everyone, especially users whose native language is not rooted in Latin. Write out their meaning instead:<ul><li>e.g. - for example</li><li>i.e. – in other words</li><li>etc. – and more/so on</li></ul> |
| **HTML** | Stands for *Hypertext Markup Language*. Write *HTML* in all caps. |
| **JS** | Stands for *JavaScript*. Write *JS* in all caps. |
| **K8** | Stands for *Kubernetes*. |
| **KVM** | Refers to a kernel-based virtual machine. Write *KVM* in all caps. |
| **sysadmin** | Avoid using abbreviations like *sysadmin* and *SysAdmin* because they’re too informal and not always easily understood. *System* should be singular (not *Systems administrator*) because it can include both a single system and multiple systems, similar to a *brain surgeon*, who works on more than one brain. <br /><br /> Taken from Red Hat Corporate Style Guide. |
| **U.S.** | As a noun, use *United States* unless there are space constraints. As an adjective, use *U.S.* (for example, *U.S. soldier*). As part of an organization, use *U.S.* <br /><br /> Taken from Red Hat Corporate Style Guide. | 
| **URL** | Stands for *Uniform Resource Locator*. Write *URL* in all caps. |
| **VM** | Refers to a virtual machine. OK to abbreviate as long as you've spelled it out once in the first occurrence and as long as *VM* won't be confused with other terms that share that acronym. <br /><br />Taken from Red Hat Corporate Style Guide. |
| **N/A** | Refers to *data not applicable*, meaning there is no relevant, matching, or applicable data.<br /><br />For example, when a filter returns no results, when a data source is empty, or when no data source is connected.|
| **--** | Refers to *data unavailable*, meaning the data exists and fits the criteria, but is not currently available to display.<br /><br />For example, when a data source is connected, but data can't be fetched due to permission restrictions or errors.|
