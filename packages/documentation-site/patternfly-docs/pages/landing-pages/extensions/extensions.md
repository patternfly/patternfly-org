# About 

Extensions are holistic solutions that utilize multiple PatternFly components, typically addressing cross-project use cases. They provide reusable code that can drive consistency throughout a userâ€™s journey across products and platforms. We welcome ideas and contributions for new extensions from the PatternFly community and will prioritize those that can be widely used by multiple projects.

To contribute an idea for a new extension, [start a discussion on GitHub.](https://github.com/orgs/patternfly/discussions/categories/extensions)
