## Scoring your accessibility

To support the proper assessment of accessibility measures, we've created a scorecard that outlines the ways that we recommend testing your UI and assessing how well it meets accessibility expectations. A completed scorecard can help you communicate the accessibility of your UI to stakeholders by clearly identifying how it meets important criteria.

Scoring your accessibility shouldn't be a one-time thing. It's something that you should do routinely to assess your product as it evolves.

An accessibility scorecard offers a higher-level overview of the current state of your product's accessibility, but it is **not intended to replace a full accessibility audit**, as described by our [accessibility testing guide](/accessibility/testing-your-accessibility). An accessibility audit is a vital part of creating your accessibility scorecard.

The following example demonstrates what a completed scorecard may look like by assessing the PatternFly.org website documentation.
