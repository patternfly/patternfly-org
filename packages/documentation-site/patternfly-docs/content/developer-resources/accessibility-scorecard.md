## PatternFly.org accessibility scorecard

The PatternFly team has created the accessibility scorecard to evaluate the state of accessibility for any UI built 
using PatternFly. The scorecard represents the state of accessibility for a UI at the date of evaluation. The 
PatternFly team has used this scorecard to evaluate the PatternFly documentation on PatternFly.org. A UI which desires 
an accessibility evaluation and scorecard can reach out via the PatternFly 
<a href="//slack.patternfly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> workspace.
