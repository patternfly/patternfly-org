## Usage

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Breadcrumbs show under the masthead.](./img/breadcrumbs-usage.svg)
</div>

Use breadcrumbs in addition to your global navigation to display a user's location in the application.

### Guidelines
* Use breadcrumbs when the primary global navigation items are not always exposed.
* Never use breadcrumbs as a replacement for global navigation.
* Breadcrumbs in PatternFly are intended to show the location of a page in the site hierarchy, and are **not intended to map the user's path through the application**.

## Placement
Breadcrumbs should be placed underneath the masthead, at the top of the page. There should be `--pf-t--global--spacer--md` (16px) of padding both between the breadcrumb and the masthead, and between the breadcrumbs and anything that comes below.
