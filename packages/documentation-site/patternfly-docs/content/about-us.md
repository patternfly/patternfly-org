## What is PatternFly?
PatternFly is an **open source design system**, dedicated to building consistent, usable enterprise software. We operate on principles of transparency and community contribution, making PatternFly accessible to everyone. Our primary goal is to empower designers and developers, enabling them to work more efficiently and build better user experiences together.

Like most design systems, we provide a comprehensive set of standards and resources to guide and streamline the design process. These resources are designed to reduce redundancy and establish a unified language for cross-functional teams, ultimately ensuring that products are visually consistent, accessible, and easy to use.

## Who uses PatternFly? 
While PatternFly is used extensively across Red Hat products, anyone can use or contribute to PatternFly. On our website, you'll find ready-to-use code samples, clear guidelines, and a variety of additional tools and resources. 

## Why does Red Hat use PatternFly?
Red Hat prefers PatternFly as its design system due to our shared commitment to open source and robust enterprise experiences. We're specifically designed to meet Red Hat's complex needs, offering customizable components and a design kit that easily translates to code.

PatternFly's development is guided by Red Hat's product requirements, allowing us to deliver custom solutions quickly, ensure strong security and compliance, and manage changes predictably. This provides better stability and confidence for Red Hat's designers and developers.

As an MIT-licensed open source project, PatternFly aligns with Red Hat's core values of transparency and direct contribution. This enables us to create tailored solutions for critical enterprise workflows and build a unified open source brand across all Red Hat products.

## Why should I use PatternFly? 
PatternFly empowers front-end developers with comprehensive documentation, native accessibility support, and flexibility through React and HTML libraries. Even new developers can create effective and inclusive interfaces.

Both designers and developers benefit from our extensive design guidelines, which offer well-documented shortcuts for simple components and complex UI solutions. We encourage product teams to shape our design system for their needs by contributing or requesting changes. 

Red Hat UX designers can use PatternFly alongside the [UXD Hub](https://www.uxd-hub.com/), which documents additional product-specific design patterns.
