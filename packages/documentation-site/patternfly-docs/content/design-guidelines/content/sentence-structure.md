## Point of view 

Use the **second person** "you/your" whenever you can. This way, your focus is on the user, and the product interaction feels more like a conversation.

Use the **first person** "I" when the user is agreeing to something. For example, a user can check a box reading, “I agree to the terms and conditions.”

Try to avoid using **third person** "he/she/they/it." Third person sounds formal and disconnected from the user.

## Voice

**Active voice** is when the subject of the sentence performs the action. **Passive voice** is when the subject of the sentence receives the action.

Use an active voice whenever possible. It makes a sentence shorter and gets the point across faster.

<div class="ws-content-table">

|**Before**  | **After** |
|------------|-----------|
| The book is being read by Matt. | Matt is reading the book. |

</div>

There are some occasions when passive voice is appropriate, like when you don’t wish to point out a subject or when you want to emphasize an action. Additionally, passive voice can help avoid assigning blame to a user, especially in error messages.
