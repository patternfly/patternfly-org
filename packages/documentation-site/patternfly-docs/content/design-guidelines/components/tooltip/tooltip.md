## Usage 
Use tooltips to:
- Provide labels for unlabeled icons.   

  <div class="ws-docs-content-img">
  ![Example showing a tooltip on an unlabeled kebab icon in a toolbar.](./img/kebab-icon.svg)
  </div>

- Provide additional information on a data point or element in a chart or table.   

  <div class="ws-docs-content-img">
  ![Example showing a tooltip on a data point in a bar chart.](./img/bar-chart.svg)
  </div>

- Define new or unfamiliar UI elements that aren’t described directly in the user interface. For example, you can use a tooltip on a disabled button.

  <div class="ws-docs-content-img">
  ![Example showing a tooltip on a disabled edit button.](./img/disabled-button.svg)
  </div>

- Provide additional information on text or labels on hover. A way for users to see more information before clicking the element and being directed to a new page or producing an action on the page.

  <div class="ws-docs-content-img">
  ![Example showing a tooltip on a hyperlink.](./img/on-hyperlink.svg)
  </div>

### Tooltip delay on hover
By default, tooltips have a 300ms entry delay when hovering over an object. Although this is the recommended delay time, you may customize it via prop. For example, if you have a tooltip on an icon, and you would like for it to appear immediately on hover, you may set the delay to 0 ms.

### When to use tooltips vs. popovers
Both tooltips and [popovers](/components/popover/design-guidelines) provide more information in context for users. However, they’re different in a few ways:

- Tooltips are used for identification purposes, while popovers are used for added description or information in context. 
- Tooltips contain short descriptions or labels, while popovers contain longer descriptions, formatted text, and optional images or links.
- Tooltips appear on hover, while popovers appear on click.
