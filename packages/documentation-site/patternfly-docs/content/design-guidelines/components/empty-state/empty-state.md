## Elements
This is an example of a large, full-page empty state with all empty state elements. Other empty state variations contain the same elements and differ only in spacing and text sizes. 

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a large empty state with all elements.](./img/elements.svg)
</div>

1. **Icon**: The icon presents a visual component for easier recognition of the empty state’s message.
2. **Heading**: The title provides a concise description of the empty state’s purpose.
3. **Body**: The body provides additional information to help the user understand why the space is empty, what they can do to move forward, and how they can benefit from taking the next step.
4. **Primary button**: The primary button enables the user to take either the next step or a more general action, such as returning to the home page. 
5. **Secondary buttons**: Secondary buttons enable the user to take alternative actions, such as accessing additional resources. 

**Note**: Don't include toolbars or filters in a full-page empty state because the user doesn't have any items to search or filter. 

## Usage  
There are several common use cases for this component
### Getting started 
Getting started empty states appear when features haven’t been used yet. In your empty state message, explain why the feature is beneficial to the user and provide a next step so that they can get started.   

Use the [extra large empty state](#extra-large-empty-state) variation for getting started empty states. 

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a full page success empty state.](./img/es-success-page.svg)
</div>

**Heading**: Confirm the action is completed. Because this is a success message, it’s OK to congratulate the user and show some excitement. Avoid extraneous terms like “success” and “successfully.”

![Example of an empty state with no accounts yet.](./img/es-creation.svg)

### Card 

You can also use the extra small empty state variation inside of a card to present the user with another way to add a new card to their view. Place the empty state card where a new card would be added, such as the first (or last) card in the view. Be sure to also include a primary button in the toolbar so that the user can still perform the action even if the empty state is out of view. 

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of an empty state in a card.](./img/es-card.svg)
</div>

## Variations

### Extra small empty state
Use an extra small empty state inside [cards](https://v4-archive.patternfly.org/v4/demos/card-view/design-guidelines/#action-card) or when there are space constraints. 

### Small empty state
Use a small empty state inside tables, wizards, or modals. 

### Large empty state
Use a large empty state as a [full page.](#full-page-empty-states)

### Extra large empty state
Use an extra large empty state for special instances only, such as [full-page success](#success) empty states or [getting started](#getting-started) empty states.

## Visual design 
Icons and colors can help enhance users’ visual understanding of empty state messaging.

### Icons
To maintain consistency, specific icons are mapped to specific empty state scenarios.

Here is when you should use each icon:

|       |Type |Color |Icon |Usage |
|---------------|------|-----|-----------|------------|
| <i class="fas fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i> |First use or get started |Gray (#8A8D90) |fa-rocket | Use in getting started empty states. You can replace this icon if you already have an application-specific graphic that you want to use instead.
| <i class="fas fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></i> |Search |Gray (#8A8D90)|fa-search |Use when there is no data to show.
| <i class="fas fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i>|Configuration |Gray (#8A8D90) |fa-wrench |Use when configuration is required or there is a configuration issue.
| <i class="fas fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i> |No access |Gray (#8A8D90) |fa-lock | Use when the user is not entitled or the user role does not have access.
| <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>|Error  |Red (#C9190B) |fa-exclamation-circle |Use when there is an inability to get data, there is backend failure, or an error has occurred.
| <i class="fas fa-check-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> |Success |Green (#486b00) |fa-check-circle |Use to indicate that a task or process has been completed successfully.
| <i class="fas fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> |Addition or creation |Gray (#8A8D90) |fa-plus-circle |Use when something needs to be added or created.

### Colors 
Use color intentionally. If you’re not using a custom icon for a specific use case, an icon should be gray by default (except when it’s used as a status icon).

## Content considerations
Content varies depending on the type of empty state. For specific information on what content to use  for each empty state type, see the earlier [Usage](#usage) section. 

Regardless of empty state variation and type, all empty states should have a specific level of detail, consistent capitalization and punctuation, and an intentional voice and tone.  

### Level of detail  
State what isn't there, and then give the user a next step. Empty states should not describe in detail how to use the page—the design should be intuitive enough without extensive written explanation.    

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Do and don't examples for level of detail in an empty state.](./img/es-details.svg)
</div>

### Capitalization and punctuation 
Use [sentence case](/ux-writing/capitalization) in your empty states: Capitalize only the first letter of the first word in the heading, body, buttons, or links. However, be sure to capitalize the first letter in all proper nouns, product names, acronyms, and initialisms, regardless of where they appear in the heading, body, buttons, or links.

Add a period at the end of full sentences in the body, but do not add a period at the end of headings or buttons. 

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Do and don't examples for capitalization in an empty state.](./img/es-capitalization.svg)
</div>

### Voice and tone
Pay close attention to the [voice and tone](/ux-writing/brand-voice-and-tone) in your empty state. Your voice should align with your company’s unique brand voice. Your tone, on the other hand, should adjust depending on the context—consider the user’s emotions and adjust your approach accordingly. 

It’s OK to use “you” and “your,” but never assign blame to the user. Also, avoid using “please” in an empty state. It’s extraneous and can make your message sound too formal.  

### Buttons and links
Use buttons and links in empty states to highlight calls to action for the user. There are multiple ways to do this.

### One primary call to action
If you have one primary call to action, you can present it as a primary button or as a link in the body text.

**Example: Call to action as a primary button** 

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of an empty state with one primary button.](./img/es-button-action.svg)
</div>

**Example: Call to action as a link in the body text** 

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of an empty state with a hyperlink.](./img/es-link-action.svg)
</div>

### Multiple calls to action
If your primary call to action is presented as a primary button, your secondary call to action can be presented as a secondary button beneath the primary button.  

**Example: Secondary call to action as a secondary button beneath the primary button** 
<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of an empty state with two action buttons.](./img/es-multi-action.svg)
</div>

If your primary call to action is presented as a link in the body text, your secondary call to action can be presented as a secondary button beneath the body text.  

**Example: Secondary call to action as a secondary button beneath the body text**  
<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of an empty state with a hyperlink and secondary action button.](./img/es-secondary-action-multi.svg)
</div>

### One secondary call to action
For a filtering or search situation, you can use a stand-alone secondary button (with nothing linked in the body).

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of an empty state with a secondary action button.](./img/es-secondary-action.svg)
</div>

### Alignment 
Empty states can be a full page, or they can be included inside of other components on the page. 

### Full-page empty states 
On a desktop, a full-page empty state should contain a 3xl spacer at the top and should be horizontally centered, with a lg spacer (or larger) on all remaining sides.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of the spacing tokens used on a full-page empty state.](./img/es-full-page-spacing.svg)
</div>

On a mobile device, a full-page empty state should contain a 2xl spacer at the top, with a md spacer (or larger) on all remaining sides.  

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of the spacing tokens used on a mobile empty state.](./img/es-mobile-spacing.svg)
</div>

### Empty states inside tables, cards, or wizards
Empty states inside a table, card, or wizard should always be horizontally and vertically centered on their background. There should be a lg spacer of outside padding on all remaining sides.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of the spacing tokens used on a table.](./img/es-table-spacing.svg)
</div>
