## Elements
<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Elements of a progress bar.](./img/progress-elements.svg)
</div>

1. **Title:** Describes the task or process underway.
2. **Track:** Illustrates the path from task start (empty) to task completion (full).
3. **Progress value:** Quantifies progress by sharing a completion percentage or time remaining. For long task sequences, progress value may be used to communicate where a user is in that sequence: “Step 1 of 6.”
4. **Indicator:** Animates the user’s progress toward completion.


## Usage
Use a progress bar to keep users informed about how much effort or time they can expect to allocate for long or ongoing processes like loading or updating an app, submitting a form, or completing a multi-step tutorial.

### When to use
* To show progress as a user completes a series of tasks.
* To indicate that the system is progressing through loading, saving, or downloading.
* To allow users to monitor a background process, especially if that process may take a long time.

### When to use progress bar vs. spinner
Depending on your use case, you might choose between 2 types of loading indicators: Progress bars and [spinners](/components/spinner). Never use a progress bar and spinner together. 

- Default to progress bars for processes that take longer than 4 seconds or require more specific information about process completion.
- If a process takes less than 4 seconds, use a [spinner](/components/spinner) instead. 

### When to use progress bar vs. progress stepper

Use a progress bar: 
- To indicate to a user that the system is progressing through a task.
- To let users monitor background tasks.

Use a [progress stepper](/components/progress-stepper):
- To indicate to a user where they are in a step-by-step linear process on a single page. 

## Variations

### Determinate progress bar

Whenever possible, use a determinate progress bar to communicate progress with measurable values like time or percentage. 

- **Percentage:** Use as a progress value if the process will take less than 1 minute to complete or a percentage will be more accurate than estimating a task’s duration.
- **Time interval:** Use as a progress value to communicate progress if the process takes more than one minute to complete. For example, “4 minutes remaining.”

### Indeterminate progress bar

Avoid using indeterminate progress bars to communicate progress that can’t be measured. To track progress that can’t be quantified with a percentage, time, or step, use a [spinner](/components/spinner) instead.

Follow these general style guidelines when designing your progress bars. For information about writing progress bar titles for each status type, see the [content considerations](#content-considerations).

### Progress bar sizes

There are 3 size options for progress bars depending on your use case: 
- **Small:** A thin progress bar to use in pages or elements without much space.
- **Default:** A basic progress bar to use in the majority of situations.
- **Large:** A thick progress bar to use when a progress value (like a percentage) is displayed within the bar or to use for prominent progress bars, like those [in a wizard](#in-a-wizard).

### In progress

A `--pf-t--global--color--brand--default` progress bar represents a process that is currently underway.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">

</div>

### Error state or failure

A `--pf-t--global--color--status--danger--default` progress bar represents a process that has failed. Accompany a failed progress bar with a [danger icon](/design-foundations/icons/#all-icons) to demonstrate that an error occurred in the process.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a progress bar in the error or failed state.](./img/error.svg)
</div>

### Complete or success

A `--pf-t--global--color--status--success--default` progress bar represents the successful completion of a process. Accompany a complete progress bar with a [check-circle icon](/design-foundations/icons/#all-icons) to demonstrate that the process has finished with no errors.

</div>

### In a table

Use a progress bar in a table to communicate the status of processes or tasks within it.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of progress bars in a table.](./img/progress-table.svg)
</div>

Place a progress bar into a table just as you would other table content. If a progress bar records the progress of multiple line items, group these items in adjoining cells and keep the progress bar inline with the first item it pertains to. For multi-item progress bars that apply to non-consecutive items, consider adding a progress bar inline with each individual item.

If your table includes multiple progress bars, designate a “Status” or “Progress” column for each one.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Multiple columns containing progress bars in a table, with a "status" and "progress" heading.](./img/progress-table-multiple.svg)
</div>

### In a dashboard view

Use a progress bar in a dashboard view to track the progress trends within each card component on a page.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a progress bar in a card on a dashboard.](./img/card-dashboard.svg)
</div>

### During a file download

Use a [toast alert](/components/alert/design-guidelines) and a progress bar to demonstrate progress during a file download.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a progress bar in a toast alert to communicate progress during a file download.](./img/progress-file-download.svg)
</div>

### In a wizard

**Never** use a progress bar in a wizard to indicate progress through wizard steps, since a wizard’s steps sidebar already communicates this information.

Only use a progress bar in a wizard if its final validation process will take more than a few seconds. As users wait for their changes to be processed, display a progress screen that includes a progress title, progress bar, and an optional 1-2 sentence description to provide more details about the validation step or give users a better idea of how long this process might take.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a progress bar in a wizard.](./img/progress-wizard.svg)
</div>

To learn more about using progress bars in wizard validation progress screens, see our [wizard guidelines](/components/wizard/design-guidelines).

## Spacing 

Right-align progress value text when it’s placed above the progress track, in line with the title. 

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a progress bar with right-aligned value text above the progress track.](./img/progress-number-above.svg)
</div>

Left-align progress value text when it’s placed to the right of the track.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Example of a progress bar with left-aligned value text in line with the progress track.](./img/progress-number-outside.svg)
</div>

Always set an “outside fixed width measure” for determinate progress bars. This fixed spacing should solve alignment use cases in which stacked progress bar values vary in length. 

## Placement

Always place progress bars in alignment with their relevant context, such as the feature, function, or task they reflect. Keep progress bars within the user’s line of sight: Never isolate a progress bar at the top or bottom of a page, or outside of its relevant content view.

<div class="ws-docs-content-img">
![Examples of dos and don'ts for placing a progress bar in your designs.](./img/progress-placement.svg)
</div>

Use progress bars to communicate progress in a variety of contexts including:

* [In a table](#in-a-table)
* [In a dashboard view](#in-a-dashboard-view)
* [During a file download](#during-a-file-download)
* [In a wizard](#in-a-wizard)


## Content considerations

Progress bars should be self-explanatory and therefore include minimal written content: A title and an optional progress value. 

In some use cases, longer progress bars might feature multiple lines of copy that change as a process moves through several phases. Default to 1 title per progress bar, unless your progress bar measures a multi-step process or procedure that isn’t detailed elsewhere.

### Styling for statuses
Styling for progress bar statuses should follow accessibility guidelines by communicating each state through several messaging types: color, microcopy, and icons. 

### Titles

Keep progress bar titles short and specific, between 1-3 words. Use verbs that clearly communicate each process and avoid using generalizations like “This may take a few minutes.” 

Never punctuate progress bar titles, since they consist of fragments, not full sentences. Avoid using ellipses to communicate a loading state — progress bars indicate a process is “in progress” on their own.

<div class="ws-content-table">

| **Don't**                      | **Do**                  |
|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Your application is downloading... | Downloading [application name]  | 
| This may take a few minutes... | Creating cache | 
| We're validating your account credentials | Validating account credentials | 

</div> 

In addition to status styling, use verb tense to communicate the state of a process: In progress, failed, or complete.

For **in progress** statuses, write your progress bar title with present participles (—ing) to share that a process is underway. Avoid passive voice by starting each title with the present participle ("-ing") form of your task’s verb.

<div class="ws-content-table">

| **Don't**                      | **Do**                  |
|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Cluster is installing | Installing cluster | 
| Cluster creation in progress | Creating cache | 

</div>

For **failed** statuses, write your progress bar title in past tense. Avoid telling users a process “failed” in favor of providing a more specific description.

<div class="ws-content-table">

| **Don't**                      | **Do**                  |
|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Cluster installation failed | Could not install cluster | 
| Account validation unsuccessful | Could not validate account credentials | 

</div>

For **complete** statuses, write your progress bar title in past tense. Use this brief line to confirm that a process or task succeeded. Avoid using adverbs like “successfully” by simply stating the action happened.

<div class="ws-content-table">

| **Don't**                      | **Do**                  |
|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Installation is complete | Cluster installed | 
| Successfully validated account credentials | Validated account credentials | 

</div>

Progress bars should only use content in their title and progress value. Never write additional content inside the progress track.
