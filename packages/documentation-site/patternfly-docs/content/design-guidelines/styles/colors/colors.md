# PatternFly colors 
This guide outlines the PatternFly color palette, as well as guidance for color use in different scenarios. Note that the color swatches and palettes automatically change to accommodate light or dark themes. To learn more about PatternFlyâ€™s dark theme, refer to our [dark theme handbook](/developer-resources/dark-theme-handbook).

In this guide, you can select each color swatch to learn more details, such as hex values and usage guidance.

    ## Primary colors
    <p>
      Primary colors are those displayed most frequently across your application screens and components. Our primary color is called **"PatternFly blue"**, which is used across PatternFly's components. PatternFly blue should change upon hover.
    </p>
    <ColorSwatch label="Default" color="--pf-v6-global--primary-color--100">
      This color indicates a default or active state for many components.
    </ColorSwatch>
    <ColorSwatch label="Hover" color="--pf-v6-global--primary-color--200">

## Typography and iconography colors
<Grid hasGutter>
  <GridItem xl={6} lg={12} className="ws-colors-gridtext">
    <p>
      Text and icon colors are extremely similar because they can often be used in the same context, such as for a link button. We support multiple shades of text colors so that you can emphasize hierarchy on both light and dark backgrounds.
    </p>
    <ColorSwatch color="--pf-v6-global--Color--100">
      This color is used for standard text and icons, and also as a hover state color for icon buttons. It is most commonly used as a text color for many components and application screens.
    </ColorSwatch>
    <ColorSwatch color="--pf-v6-global--Color--200">
      This color is used as a secondary text color and as a default color for icon buttons. It is most commonly used for many components, such as the app launcher and empty states.

## Background colors
<Grid hasGutter>
  <GridItem xl={6} lg={12} className="ws-colors-gridtext">
    <p>

## Status and state colors

## Shadows
<Grid hasGutter>
  <GridItem xl={6} lg={12} className="ws-colors-gridtext">
    <p>
      Shadows can be used to create contrast between UI elements. PatternFly supports different shadow sizes, which enable you to increase the visual depth of a UI element and distinguish it from other elements on the screen. 
    </p>
    <ColorSwatch label="Large" color="--pf-v6-global--BoxShadow--lg">
      Large shadows create the most contrast and depth for a UI element. These are commonly used for alerts and modals.
    </ColorSwatch>
    <ColorSwatch label="Medium" color="--pf-v6-global--BoxShadow--md">
      Medium shadows fall between small and large shadows, creating moderate contrast and depth for a UI element. These are commonly used for accordions and dropdowns. 
    </ColorSwatch>
    <ColorSwatch label="Small" color="--pf-v6-global--BoxShadow--sm">
      Small shadows offer minimal, but visible shadows that slightly increase the contrast and depth of a UI element. These are most commonly used for cards. 
    </ColorSwatch>
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem xl={6} lg={12}>
    <img width="443px" src="./patternfly-shadows.png" alt="PatternFly shadows" />
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

<Divider className="ws-colors-divider" />

## Contrast ratios

[PatternFly's goal](/accessibility/patternflys-accessibility/) is to meet [level AA in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/). To meet level AA requirements, your UI contrast ratios must be at or above 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text, and 3:1 for graphics and other UI components. Additionally, on hover, link text color should have ample contrast from both the background color and the default state link color.

To check the contrast between background and text colors, use a <a href="https://color.a11y.com/?wc3" target="_blank" className="pf-m-link">WCAG AA-compliance tool.</a>

## PatternFly palettes
Our color palettes are created as a system, designed to reinforce content and workflows. Our palettes are carefully chosen to support effective communication and adapt to the needs of your UI.

Note that bright colors are used sparingly and are reserved for specific interactions, such as communicating status.

Our color palettes are organized into "families" that contain different shades of the same hue. In the following palettes, you can expand each value color or shadow in a family to see more details.

  <GridItem xl2RowSpan={1} xl2={4} xl={6} xlRowSpan={2} sm={12}>
