A **title** component applies top and bottom margins, font-weight, font-size, and line-height to titles.

**Keyboard users** should not be able to reach a title using **Tab**, as titles are not interactive.

**Screen reader users** should be able to navigate to the title and read its text. Titles should be clear, descriptive, and make sense out of context (such as when a screen reader navigates by headings).

## To make title accessible:
- Choose appropriate headings to indicate sections and subsections of content rather than choosing heading levels for their formatting. A common practice is to use a single **h1** for the primary headline or logo on a page, **h2**s to designate major sections, and **h3**s for supporting subsections.
