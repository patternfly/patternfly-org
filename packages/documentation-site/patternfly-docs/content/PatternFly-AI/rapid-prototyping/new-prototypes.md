# Starting new prototypes

This guide provides instructions for setting up new PatternFly prototypes using AI-assisted development tools.

Before you get started, review [best practices for AI-assisted prototyping](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/rapid-prototyping#best-practices-for-ai-assisted-prototyping).

If you need to add AI tools to existing codebases instead, follow our guidelines for [enhancing existing projects](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/enhancing-existing-projects).

## Project setup

For new prototypes, we recommend using the [patternfly-react-seed](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react-seed) application as your starting point. This application provides AI tools with immediate access to PatternFly context and guidelines, which offers better support for vibe coding.

The patternfly-react-seed comes pre-configured with:

- A basic PatternFly React application structure.
- The patternfly-ai-coding tool already integrated and ready to use.
- Essential dependencies and build configuration.
- Example components and patterns to reference.

### Set up the patternfly-react-seed

1. Clone or download the patternfly-react-seed repository.
2. Install dependencies according to [the project's README](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react-seed?tab=readme-ov-file#patternfly-seed).
3. Start the development server.
4. Begin prototyping with your AI development tools.

## How to prototype

Once you've installed and set up the patternfly-react-seed, with the patternfly-ai-coding tool, follow these steps to begin prototyping: 

1. **Define your scope**: Clearly articulate what you want to build using [vibe coding principles](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/rapid-prototyping#effective-prompting-with-vibe-coding). Describe the experience, not the technical implementation.
2. **Leverage AI assistance**: Use AI tools to generate PatternFly components based on your requirements, communicating through natural language descriptions of user needs and design intent.
3. **Iterate and refine**: Review generated code and make adjustments as needed, continuing to use vibe coding to guide refinements.
4. **Test and validate**: Ensure your prototype meets design and functional requirements.
