# Enhancing existing projects

This guide provides instructions for integrating AI-assisted PatternFly development tools into your existing codebase.

Before you get started, review [best practices for AI-assisted prototyping](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/rapid-prototyping#best-practices-for-ai-assisted-prototyping) and learn about [vibe coding principles](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/rapid-prototyping#what-is-vibe-coding) for effective AI-assisted development.

If you need to start a new project, follow our guidelines for [starting a new prototype](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/new-prototypes).

## Why enhance existing projects?

If you have an existing codebase that you'd like to enhance with AI-driven PatternFly development, you can integrate the **[patternfly-ai-coding tool](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-ai-coding)** directly into your project. This tool can be pulled into any existing codebase to:

- Improve future AI-driven development sessions.
- Provide AI tools with PatternFly-specific context and best practices.
- Enable more accurate code generation for PatternFly components.
- Reduce common implementation mistakes.

## The patternfly-ai-coding tool

The [patternfly-ai-coding tool](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-ai-coding) is a collection of AI-friendly documentation files designed to guide Large Language Models and AI development assistants toward successful PatternFly implementation.

Once you've integrated this tool, you'll notice a variety of benefits for AI-assisted rapid prototyping, including:
- More accurate PatternFly component suggestions.
- Better adherence to PatternFly design patterns.
- Reduced need for manual corrections.
- Improved consistency across your codebase.
- Tools that evolve to better cater to your specific project needs.

### What it includes

- **AI-friendly knowledge base**: Current PatternFly documentation formatted for optimal AI consumption.
- **Relevant examples**: Code samples and implementation patterns.
- **Common pitfalls**: Documentation of frequent mistakes and how to avoid them.
- **Best practices**: Proven approaches for PatternFly development.
- **Cross-linked files**: Interconnected documentation that helps AI tools quickly find relevant information.
- **Cursor rules**: Special configuration files that flag important PatternFly context for the Cursor AI editor.

### How it works

1. The tool provides static files (primarily markdown) that contain comprehensive PatternFly guidance.
2. These files are loaded into a development project alongside your code.
3. AI development tools can reference this context when generating PatternFly components.
4. The result is more accurate, PatternFly-compliant code generation.

## Set up patternfly-ai-coding

1. Download the [patternfly-ai-coding tool](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-ai-coding) from the repository.
2. Copy the tool files into your existing project structure.
3. Configure your AI development environment to recognize the new context files.
4. Test the integration by generating some PatternFly components.
5. Customize as needed for your specific project requirements.
