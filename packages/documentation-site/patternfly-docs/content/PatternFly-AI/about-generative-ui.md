# PatternFly + Generative UIs

## What is generative UI?

Generative UI is an emerging approach to user interface design that leverages artificial intelligence to dynamically create and adapt interface elements based on context, user needs, and data. Unlike traditional static interfaces, generative UIs can produce layouts, components, and visual styles in real-time, offering more flexible and personalized user experiences.

## PatternFly's exploration: Compass

Generative UI represents a significant opportunity for PatternFly to explore new patterns, layouts, and styles that support AI-driven interface generation. PatternFly has been calling this proof of concept Compass. It investigates how the design system can evolve to support generative UI use cases.

### What Compass includes

The Compass POC introduces several new capabilities:

- **Compass layout component**: [link needed] A new layout component designed specifically for generative UI patterns
- **Additional components and component variants**:
  - [links needed]
- **Design tokens**: New design tokens that enable:
  - Glass-like visual effects (glassmorphism)
  - Background and border gradients
  - Additional smooth animations
  - Background image explorations
- **Demos**: a suite of full page demos showing how to wire up the building blocks into a Compass like experience [linked needed]

### Accessibility focus

Accessibility has been a major focus throughout the Compass exploration. As generative UIs introduce new interaction patterns and visual styles, ensuring these experiences remain accessible to all users is paramount.

### Current status

The Compass effort is actively in progress. Components are being built, evaluated, and refined based on feedback. The design is continuously evolving as we learn more about generative UI patterns and their practical applications.

**Important**: Compass is best suited for use as a POC in other proof-of-concept generative UI use cases. It is **not yet production quality code** and should be used for exploration and experimentation purposes only.

### AI-enabled seed app

We are creating an AI-enabled seed app that you can use to create your own PatternFly Compass-based POC. The seed app includes the Compass layout fully wired out with all styles set up, providing a solid foundation that you can build on top of. It can be leveraged with AI tools like Cursor or Claude Code to build out your own POC, making it easier to experiment with generative UI patterns and explore new use cases. [link needed]
