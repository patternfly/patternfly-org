## PatternFly 6 alpha 2

As we continue to work towards the full release of PatternFly 6, we're excited to share an update. This release contains the final changes to the PatternFly 6 alpha. We've fixed the bugs that have been found so far and have continued to make progress towards our final PatternFly 6 vision. 

Thanks for your participation in the alpha release: the beta is coming soon!

### Expanded PatternFly 6 support
We added PatternFly 6 styling and token support to additional areas of our design system: 
- Extensions
- Charts 

### Addressed issues throughout the system
We cleaned up and fixed bugs in a number of areas:
- We removed Sass global variables in favor of our tokens.
- We renamed variables that previously had top/right/bottom/left in the name (for example, `PaddingTop`) to instead match inline/block start/end properties (for example, `PaddingBlockStart`). This change is a result of our introduction of [RTL support.](/developer-resources/right-to-left-handbook)
- We removed the deprecated Sass `@import` rule in favor of new recommendations, `@use` and `@forward`.
- We fixed various bugs that were reported following the initial alpha release.

## PatternFly 6 alpha 1

We're excited to announce that our alpha release of PatternFly 6 is now live. Here are the highlights that you should know about!

### PatternFly 6 visual theme

As you've probably already noticed on the alpha website: PatternFly 6 has a new look. Our brand new visual theme is more modern and refined, so that you can create UIs that are more seamless and lightweight.

All of our components have a new look to match. As you use the alpha website, take a look at our component examples, demos, and patterns to explore our redesign.

### Design tokens 

In order to support PatternFly 6, and any future visual theming capabilities, we have implemented a design token system for PatternFly. For more details and instructions on how to use tokens, you can refer to our new [design token documentation.](/tokens/about-tokens)

Our tokens cover both dark and light themes, and make it easier to support both in your product. We also updated our [dark theme handbook](/developer-resources/dark-theme-handbook) to align with our tokens.

**Note:** The PatternFly 5 design library is not built with tokens. To take advantage of our token system, you must [upgrade your product to PatternFly 6.](/get-started/upgrade)
