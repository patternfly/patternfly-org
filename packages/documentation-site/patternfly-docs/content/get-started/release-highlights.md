## PatternFly 6 alpha

We're excited to announce that our alpha release of PatternFly 6 is now live. Here are the highlights that you should know about!

### PatternFly 6 visual theme

As you've probably already noticed on the alpha website: PatternFly 6 has a new look. Our brand new visual theme is more modern and refined, so that you can create UIs that are more seamless and lightweight.

All of our components have a new look to match. As you use the alpha website, take a look at our component examples, demos, and patterns to explore our redesign.

### Design tokens 

In order to support PatternFly 6, and any future visual theming capabilities, we have implemented a design token system for PatternFly. For more details and instructions on how to use tokens, you can refer to our new [design token documentation.](/tokens/about-tokens)

Our tokens cover both dark and light themes, and make it easier to support both in your product. We also updated our [dark theme handbook](/developer-resources/dark-theme-handbook) to align with our tokens.

**Note:** The PatternFly 5 design library is not built with tokens. To take advantage of our token system, you must [upgrade your product to PatternFly 6.](/get-started/upgrade)
