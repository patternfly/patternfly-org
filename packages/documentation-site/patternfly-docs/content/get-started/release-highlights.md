## PatternFly 6 beta
We’re excited to share the next milestone in our journey to PatternFly 6–our beta release! This beta introduces more improvements and refinement, and contains all major PatternFly 6 features. 
Your continued participation, support, and feedback will help ensure that PatternFly 6 is as well-tested and bug-free as possible before the full release. 
### Design updates
#### Rem units
We updated our sizing system to be based on rems, instead of pixels. Rems are relative units that adjust font size based on a webpage's HTML document root element size. For example, if the root size is 10px, a rem size of 1.5 would be 15px. This allows you to scale your font sizes, based on a root size of your choice. PatternFly's default root element size is 16px.
#### Motion framework 
We created a framework for micro animation CSS tokens, which will be used to enable component animations in future minor releases.
### Content updates 

We made more improvements to our website docs, to ensure that they're accurate and inline with our new token system. A variety of pages and sections were updated, including: 
- All tokens pages: 
    - [About tokens](/tokens/about-tokens)
    - [All PatternFly tokens](/tokens/all-patternfly-tokens)
    - [Develop with tokens](/tokens/develop-with-tokens)
    - [Design with tokens](/tokens/design-with-tokens)
- Our design foundations 
    - [Colors](/design-foundations/colors) 
    - [Icons](/design-foundations/icons) 
    - [Spacers](/design-foundations/spacers)  
    - [Typography](/design-foundations/typography)  
### Component updates
We promoted some of our beta and "next" components to become standard components in PatternFly 6. These will be fully-supported features going forward:
- Buttons with count label 
- Editable labels
- Flyout and drilldown menus and navigation 
- Menu toggle with status indicator
- Modal title with status indicator
- Inline spinners
- Timestamp component 

We updated some of our components to make room for additional features, including:
- Multiple page body elements within the page component.
- Icons in navigation items.

We also made updates to some of our component structure and naming conventions. We:
- Renamed the "text" component to ["content."](/components/content)
    - Added `<hr>` element support to the content component.
- Refactored pagination to use menu toggle rather than options menu.
- Updated the `<ToolbarItem>` `variant` prop options: 
    - Replaced "chip-group" with "label-group", to align with the deprecation of chip. 
    - (Previously) Removed "bulk-select", "overflow-menu", and "search-filter" variants for `<ToolbarItem>`.
- Restructured the masthead component: 
    - Renamed `<MastheadBrand>` to `<MastheadLogo>`
    - Renamed `<MastheadMain>` to `<MastheadBrand>`
    - Wrapped `<MastheadToggle>` and `<MastheadBrand>` in `<MastheadMain>`
    - Updated our documentation to align with the new structure.
- Restructured the empty state component:
    - Made it less composable, in order to address styling issues.
    - Updated `<EmptyStateHeader>` and `<EmptyStateIcon>` to be rendered internally within `<EmptyState>`. They should now only be customized using props. 
    - Updated the content passed to the icon prop on `<EmptyState>` to be wrapped by `<EmptyStateIcon>` automatically.
    - Made the `titleText` prop required.
### Extension updates

We applied PatternFly 6 styles to the rest of our extensions. All have now been upgraded to use the PatternFly 6 beta: 
- Topology 
- Component groups
- React console
- Log viewer
- User feedback
- Catalog view
- Quickstarts

Related design resources can also be found in [our PatternFly 6 Figma kit.](https://www.figma.com/@patternfly)

### Bug fixes
We fixed bugs that were reported throughout the alpha period including. We:
- Fixed an issue with displaying card hover/click states in the user feedback extension.
- Updated buttons to support wrappers, which fixes padding issues.
- Updated our documentation to replace terms from deprecated components. For example, replacing "chip" with "label" across React property names.
- Fixed various small accessibility bugs.
- Removed deprecated or unused properties across some of our components.

## PatternFly 6 alpha 1

We're excited to announce that our alpha release of PatternFly 6 is now live. Here are the highlights that you should know about!

### PatternFly 6 visual theme

As you've probably already noticed on the alpha website: PatternFly 6 has a new look. Our brand new visual theme is more modern and refined, so that you can create UIs that are more seamless and lightweight.

All of our components have a new look to match. As you use the alpha website, take a look at our component examples, demos, and patterns to explore our redesign.

### Design tokens 

In order to support PatternFly 6, and any future visual theming capabilities, we have implemented a design token system for PatternFly. For more details and instructions on how to use tokens, you can refer to our new [design token documentation.](/tokens/about-tokens)

Our tokens cover both dark and light themes, and make it easier to support both in your product. We also updated our [dark theme handbook](/developer-resources/dark-theme-handbook) to align with our tokens.

**Note:** The PatternFly 5 design library is not built with tokens. To take advantage of our token system, you must [upgrade your product to PatternFly 6.](/get-started/upgrade)
