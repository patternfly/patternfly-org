## PatternFly 5 release notes

import { ReleaseNotesTable } from './release-notes-table.js';

This resource is intended to aid developers in their upgrade from PatternFly 4 to PatternFly 5 by documenting our change log in a table that allows for searching, filtering, and sorting.
This table does not contain a completely comprehensive list of changes, as it does not include information about dependency bumps and documentation updates.

Comprehensive PatternFly 5 release notes can be found on GitHub regarding changes to [@patternfly/patternfly](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/releases) and [@patternfly/react-core](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/releases).

A higher level overview of the changes introduced with PatternFly 5 can be found in the [release highlights](/get-started/release-highlights/).
