## PatternFly 6 React breaking changes

import { ReleaseNotesTable } from './release-notes-table.js';

This resource organizes the PatternFly 5 to PatternFly 6 change log in a table that allows for searching, filtering, and sorting.
Note that this table does not contain a completely comprehensive list of changes, as it does not include information about dependency bumps and documentation updates.

Comprehensive PatternFly 6 release notes can be found on GitHub, in [@patternfly/patternfly](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/releases) and [@patternfly/react-core](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/releases).

A summary of the changes from PatternFly 6 can be found in our [release highlights](/releases/release-highlights/).
