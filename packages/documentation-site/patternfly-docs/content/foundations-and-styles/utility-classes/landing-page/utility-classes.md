# Overview

PatternFly’s utility classes enable you to further customize and modify elements in your project without having to write any custom CSS.

For example, you might use a utility class to add additional spacing between elements, align content in a layout, or add a box shadow to an element.

<SectionGallery
  section="foundations-and-styles"
  subsection="utility-classes"
  galleryItemsData={utilityClassesData}
  placeholderText="Search by name"
  includeSubsections={false}
  hasGridText={true}
  isFullWidth={false}
/>
