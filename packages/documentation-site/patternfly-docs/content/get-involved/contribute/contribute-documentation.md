We invite writers and subject matter experts to contribute to our website documentation. By helping us explain new concepts, provide better guidance, and outline important resources, you can help us improve the PatternFly.org experience for everyone.

## Where do I start?

A great way to get familiar with our team's processes is to [attend our biweekly office hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=patternflyteam%40gmail.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). You can listen in on discussions or sign up for a time to ask questions and chat with the team.

When you're ready to contribute, the best place to start is by finding an existing documentation issue.

## Find an existing documentation issue

Our website documentation is contained in the [patternfly-org repository](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/issues), where you can find a list of open issues.

If you find an issue you'd like to work on, leave a comment or reach out on [our #general Slack channel](https://patternfly.slack.com/archives/C293LQ36J) and a team member will reach out with next steps. As you work, you can refer to our [contribution guide](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org/wiki/Contribution-guide) for additional guidance.

## Propose new documentation

If you'd like to contribute new content, such as updates to design guidelines or entirely new pages, you can propose your idea by opening an issue in the [patternfly-org repo](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-org). Content for design guidelines should adhere to our [writing style guide](/ux-writing/writing-patternfly-design-guidelines). From there, our team will work with you to author and publish your new content.
