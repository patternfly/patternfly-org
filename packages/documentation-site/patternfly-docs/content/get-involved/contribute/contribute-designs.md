We invite anyone with skills in visual and interaction design to contribute to PatternFly's design by working on an existing issue or proposing a new feature, enhancement, or icon. 

## Where do I start? 

A great way to get familiar with our team's processes is to [attend our biweekly office hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=patternflyteam%40gmail.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). You can listen in on discussions or sign up for a time to ask questions and chat with the team.

When you're ready to contribute, the best place to start is by finding an existing design issue to work on.

## Find an existing design issue

The PatternFly design team manages its backlog on [the design issues project board](https://github.com/orgs/patternfly/projects/7/views/58) in GitHub. The "No Sprint" view at the bottom of this board contains a list of unassigned issues that are ready for community contribution. 

If you see something that you'd like to work on, leave a comment on the issue or reach out on [our patternfly-design Slack channel](https://patternfly.slack.com/archives/CGR204RM2).

## Propose a new feature or enhancement
If you have an idea for a new design pattern, a new component type, or an existing feature improvement, we'd love to hear it. Start by opening an issue in [our patternfly-design repository.](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/issues) From there, a member of our team will reach out and work with you to plan and design a solution.

## Propose a new icon
We encourage designers to work with [the existing PatternFly icon set](/design-foundations/icons), which covers most common use cases. If your use case isn't covered, you can propose a new icon.

To contribute a new icon, start by opening an issue in [our patternfly-design repository](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/issues) that describes your idea and why it's needed. A member of our team will reach out to you to discuss next steps.
