## General FAQs

### About PatternFly 

For more information about PatternFly, [check out our "About" page.](/get-started/about-patternfly)

#### What is PatternFly and who can use it? 

PatternFly is an open source design system for enterprise software. PatternFly is maintained by Red Hat and is used extensively across Red Hat products, but anyone can use or contribute to PatternFly. 

#### Who works on PatternFly?

The PatternFly team is part of Red Hat's User Experience Design team and is composed of more than 20 designers, developers, and writers. 

#### How often is PatternFly updated? 

We publish a major release when we need to release breakings changes that will require significant consumer updates that will alter the way your product's code interacts with PatternFly. These are our single version numbers, like PatternFly 4, 5, or 6.

We publish a minor release each quarter to introduce non-breaking changes, including enhancements, bug fixes, and new features. These increase the sub-version of a major release, like PatternFly 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3.

We occasionally share patch releases between our quarterly minor releases for timely bug fixes that can't wait until the end of the quarter. These increase the sub-version of a minor release, like PatternFly 6.1.1, 6.1.2, or 6.1.3.

#### What is the latest version of PatternFly?

We are currently on version 6 of PatternFly&mdash;also known as "PatternFly 6". You can view the current minor and patch release version within [our release highlights.](https://www.patternfly.org/get-started/release-highlights)
