The PatternFly team is available to help answer any questions that you can't find the answer to on our website. There are a couple of ways to get in touch with our team quickly. 

## Before you reach out, check out our resources

We eagerly welcome Flyers to reach out to us and start discussions, but it's a great first step to explore our resources and search our comprehensive website documentation for answers to your questions. 

In addition to the detailed design guidelines you can find on our website for components, extensions, patterns, and foundational practices, we publish answers to frequently asked questions in [our FAQs guide.](/get-help/faqs). While we can't predict every question you may have, this guide addresses some of the most common ones. 

## Join our office hours 

Every two weeks, the PatternFly team sets aside time to address any questions or issues presented by Flyers in our design and development office hours. To keep track of our meeting schedule, [add our Google Calendar to yours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=patternflyteam%40gmail.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).

Any PatternFly-related topic is welcome at this meeting, where you can directly talk face to face with the team that builds and maintains PatternFly. Topics often include questions specific to a design and development challenge, with many attendees presenting in-progress work for feedback.  

If there's something you'd like to discuss in this meeting, [sign up for a topic in advance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ltdRXX4U-FLunZpPdmQjATZHUTxjyTh-BGsoqdFKTs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fdgi7w700vmz), so that we can plan ahead and predict the amount of time each topic will take. If you have something to share at this meeting, but you can't make it, you can have someone else come and present on your behalf. 

## Reach out to the team

The best way to reach the team is to [join the PatternFly Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/patternfly/shared_invite/zt-3dcejyvj6-MU93z8IVihJXxbs2ggrMEw). If you're a Red Hatter, you can also reach out on the [#list-patternfly](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04JMHKSD9C) channel within the Red Hat Internal workspace.
