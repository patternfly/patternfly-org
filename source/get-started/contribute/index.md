## Who can contribute?

Anyone can contribute a design pattern or code sample. We are looking for contributions that complement existing PatternFly content and provide the community with flexible solutions that can be applied across multiple applications.

## How can I contribute a design pattern?

**Step 1: Email the PatternFly [mailing list][1] with your ideas. **This serves a couple different purposes. First, it makes the PatternFly team aware of your efforts so that we can provide support and answer your questions as needed. Also, it encourages collaboration and open communication with the PatternFly community.

**Step 2: Design and define your pattern. **The following are requirements for a PatternFly Pattern submission:

  * Overview: Describe the pattern at a high-level.
  * Usage Scenarios: Describe when to use this pattern. For example, use radio buttons when the user can only select one option.
  * Sample Images: Provide an image that identifies the components of the pattern and a description of each of those components. Note, a prototype can be submitted in lieu of a sample image assuming that it illustrates all permutations of the pattern.
  * Description: Provide a description of how the proposed pattern behaves. Note, a prototype can be submitted in lieu of the description assuming the prototype clearly simulates the behavior.

The following are supplemental to a pattern submission but not considered required.

  * Prototype: Provide an interactive that simulates how the design should look and behave.
  * Implementation: Add a link to implementation on GitHub
  * Usability Results: If you have completed usability tests or gathered user feedback, either add a summary of those usability test results or provide a link to those results.

**Step 3: Share your pattern for review. **When the proposal is ready to be reviewed, send an email to the PatternFly [mailing list][1] with a link or an attachment that contains the pattern proposal.  You can expect some follow up questions and feedback, which may require additional updates, clarifications or considerations before it can be approved.

**Step 4: Get published. **After the pattern has been approved, we will add the pattern to our queue to get published to the site. New content is identified on the What’s New page.

## How can I contribute markup?

Visit the [PatternFly Github site][2].

## Who is the review team?

We are a group of UX practitioners focused on user experience design for IT enterprise applications and dedicated to continuing and building the scope of the PatternFly project.

## How does the review work?

After the pattern proposal and/or sample code is submitted for review, you can expect some follow up questions and feedback, which may require updates, clarifications and/or considerations. Once this process is complete, the review team will vote on your proposal.  A majority of “yes” votes is required for approval.
