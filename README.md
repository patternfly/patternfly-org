# patternfly-org

The PatternFly Org is the source for the official documentation for PatternFly 3 and PatternFly 4.

## Development Setup

Development setup requires yarn. If you do not already have yarn installed on your system, see https://yarnpkg.com/en/.

### Build

Clone the repo and submodules:

    git clone --recurse-submodules

Note: If repo is cloned without submodules, use the following commands to update submodules:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Install the site dependencies and build it using yarn:

    yarn install
    yarn prebuild

The packages/patternfly-3 site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
The packages/patternfly-4 site is generated using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### Live Reload Server

A local development server can be quickly fired up for PatternFly 3 or PatternFly 4 by using either of these commands:

    yarn start:pf3
    yarn start:pf4

### Testing production build

You can test the full production build:
    yarn build
    yarn start:prod

### Deploy

The site is deployed using GitHub pages to the patternfly/patternfly.github.io repository. A CNAME file is added to the root which associates the GitHub pages url with https://www.patternfly.org
